## Key Insights from Meeting Transcript

### The "Teach to Fish" Framing

> "We're not just teaching students to use AI tools—we're teaching them HOW TO THINK about AI problems. The foundational shift in mindset must come before the tools can be used effectively."

This framing distinguishes AI Studio Teams from typical AI training programs:
- **Traditional approach**: "Give them the fish" (prompts, templates, tool tutorials)
- **SkaFld approach**: "Teach them to fish" (metacognitive skills, decomposition thinking, cross-domain pattern recognition)

### The SkaFld Ideation Methodology (UPF)

Core principle from Charles:
> "The best solution to your problem probably exists in a field you've never explored. It is your job to find it, translate it, and prove it."

Three pillars:
1. **Research Wide, Validate Narrow** - Look outside your domain first
2. **Decomposition Thinking** - Break complex challenges into yes/no decisions
3. **Cross-Domain Translation** - Interdisciplinary pattern recognition

### Human-Centered Language Priority

Keith emphasized alignment with Stanford GSE's priorities:
> "This program puts educators and learners at the heart of AI design—ensuring these tools expand access, agency, and connection rather than replacing the human relationships essential to learning."

## SkafldSpark Platform Capabilities

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-4O
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Compliance**: COPPA/FERPA ready design

### Key Features for AI Studio Teams
| Feature | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Trailhead AI Assistant | Project coaching, decomposition guidance |
| Activity Builder | Teacher-created structured activities |
| Portfolio Library | Student work archive + employer review |
| Analytics Dashboard | Progress tracking, at-risk identification |
| Gamification | Badges, streaks, skill levels |
| Safety & Compliance | Content moderation, consent management |

### Scalability Advantage
Platform model enables district-level implementation without requiring SkaFld direct facilitation—critical for sustainability beyond Year 1.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Lead with the "Why"
Position the mindset shift (teach to fish) before the mechanics (portfolio, mentorship, employer integration).

### 2. Emphasize Platform Scalability
SkafldSpark enables replication beyond El Segundo—key differentiator for Stanford's impact focus.

### 3. Use Stanford's Language
Mirror GSE terminology: human-centered, interdisciplinary, evidence-based, equity by design.

### 4. Validate All Citations
Learning science citations must be bulletproof for GSE audience—verify every claim.

### 5. Connect to Interdisciplinary Mission
The SkaFld methodology's cross-domain approach aligns with Stanford's interdisciplinary values.
