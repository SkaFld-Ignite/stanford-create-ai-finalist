## Critical Errors Found

### 1. Resnick & Resnick (1992) - INCORRECT CLAIM

**Original claim**: "Portfolios predict job performance better than GPA"

**Problem**: Lauren Resnick and Daniel Resnick's 1992 work ("Assessing the Thinking Curriculum") focuses on educational assessment reform, NOT employment prediction. They wrote about authentic assessment in schools, not job performance validation.

**Correction**: Replace with **Schmidt & Hunter (1998)** - "The Validity and Utility of Selection Methods in Personnel Psychology"
- This meta-analysis of 85 years of research actually demonstrates that work samples (r=.54) predict job performance far better than education credentials (r=.10)
- Published in Psychological Bulletin, highly authoritative

### 2. Rivera (2015) - MISREPRESENTED FINDING

**Original claim**: "Portfolio-based hiring reduces demographic bias"

**Problem**: Lauren Rivera's 2015 book "Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs" argues the OPPOSITE—that hiring processes at elite firms reproduce social inequality through cultural matching and credentialism. Using her work to support bias reduction is a fundamental misread.

**Correction**: Replace with:
- **Goldin & Rouse (2000)** - "Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of 'Blind' Auditions on Female Musicians" - demonstrates that work-sample evaluation (blind auditions) significantly reduced gender bias
- **Bohnet (2016)** - "What Works: Gender Equality by Design" - evidence-based interventions for reducing bias in hiring
