# Track 3 Update Plan: Stanford CREATE+AI Finals

**Generated:** February 3, 2026
**Deadline:** Thursday, February 5th (deck due) | February 10th (pitch day)
**Pitch Format:** 6 minutes presentation + 4 minutes Q&A

---

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the team discussion from the February 3rd meeting transcript with Stanford's evaluation criteria to create a comprehensive update plan for the Track 3 pitch deck and supporting materials.

---

## Part 1: Key Insights from Team Discussion

### 1.1 Narrative Flow Issues Identified

The current pitch deck needs reorganization for better narrative flow. Key structural changes discussed:

| Current State | Required Change | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Problem → Solution jumps too quickly | Add credential devaluation in problem slide | Experience paradox AND credential devaluation are interlinked problems |
| Three pillars mentioned but not prominently placed | Create dedicated pillars section after methodology | Need transitionary slide between methodology and platform |
| Portfolio-based approach mentioned but unclear | Make portfolio vs credentials differentiation EXPLICIT | This is the core thesis and differentiator |
| "Forever" in metacognitive skills statement | Remove "forever" - skills evolve over time | More accurate; relates to continuous learning/Kaizen |

### 1.2 Language & Terminology Updates

| Remove/Change | Replace With | Source |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| "Farm System for Talent Development" (slide footer) | Alternative: "Rebuilding the bridge" or healthcare analogy | Team felt "farm system" was dated (8 years old) |
| "Stanford Way" / "Stanford DNA" | "Technology, Design, Policy" | Avoid potential brand violation |
| "Not Just the Privileged" | Remove comparison entirely | Focus on positive: "Access for all, focus on what you can do" |
| "Focusing on what you can do, not who you know" | Consider: "Unlocking unrealized potential" | "Who you know" IS important; focus on potential vs current skills |
| "Forever" (metacognitive skills) | "...that transfer across any AI tool" (period) | Skills and tools evolve; nothing is forever |

### 1.3 Content Additions Required

#### A. Human-Centered Design / Policy & Strategy

**Critical Addition:** Stanford GSE cares deeply about humanities and human-centered design. Need to explicitly show HOW students learn responsible AI practices, not just that we have guardrails.

> "Policy and strategy are complementary parts of AI training because they provide essential context for technical work. Policy helps students understand ethical and governance boundaries; strategy demonstrates how AI projects align with organizational goals. Together, they enable students to see how responsible design and strategic thinking shape effective real-world AI solutions."

**Placement:** Add to solution narrative or learning science section. Speak to during pitch.

#### B. Stanford Accelerator Language

**Mirror their language back to them:**
> "Accelerator Studio enables development and impact of research that improves learning."

Adaptation for AI Studio Teams:
> "AI Studio Teams enables development and impact of [living research/authentic practice] that improves learning."

#### C. Teaching How to LEARN, Not Just AI

**Key Quote from Discussion:**
> "We're not just teaching AI, we're teaching how to learn. The skills transfer across any AI tool because we're teaching the right way to think about interacting with AI to achieve your end goal."

This needs to be more explicit in the pitch narrative.

### 1.4 Slide Reorganization Plan

**Current Flow (12 slides):**
1. Title
2. The Crisis (Experience Paradox)
3. Don't Give Fish / Teach to Fish

### 1.5 Team Slide Reformatting

**New Format per Team Member:**
1. **Critical Role** (at SkaFld for this project)
2. **Domain Expertise** (general background)
3. **Relevant Credentials** (specific to this project)

**Mike Belloli Updates:**
- Remove "Stanford DNA" language
- Change to: "Technology, Design, Policy"
- Keep: Stanford BA '86, mediaX Advisory Scholar (remove dates)
- Update: "UN Joint SDG Fund" → "UN Joint SDG Fund Breakthrough Alliance Co-Chair"

## Part 2: Stanford Evaluation Alignment

### Stanford's Stated Criteria (from Finalist Memo)

1. **6-minute pitch** + 4-minute Q&A
2. **Panel of 7 judges** (likely academics + possibly industry)
3. **Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities** (one of 3 finalists; 2 get $50K, 1 gets $20K)

### Stanford Accelerator for Learning Mission

> "Accelerator Studio enables development and impact of research that improves learning."

**Our alignment:** AI Studio Teams is a form of "living research" - real-world application that improves learning outcomes through authentic practice.

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Portfolio-Based vs Credential-Based** (our core thesis)
2. **Human-Centered Design** (not just guardrails, but teaching ethical reasoning)
3. **Interdisciplinary Approach** (mirrors Stanford's cross-disciplinary philosophy)
4. **Teaching HOW to learn** (metacognitive skills, not just tool prompts)
5. **Real employer integration** (not simulation)

## Part 3: Specific Edit List

### 3.1 Pitch Deck Edits (pitch.mdx)

#### Slide 2 (Crisis) - ADD Credential Devaluation
```
ADD to split-layout:
- Credential Devaluation Problem
- "A degree demonstrates coursework completion, not workplace capability"
- Connect to: why portfolio-based approach is the answer
```

#### Slide 3 (Teach to Fish) - Remove "forever"
```
CHANGE: "We teach metacognitive skills that transfer across any AI tool, forever."
TO: "We teach metacognitive skills that transfer across any AI tool."

ADD context about: Skills and tools evolve, but the WAY of thinking persists
```

#### Slide 7 (Methodology) - Remove "Stanford Way"
```
CHANGE: "The Stanford Way"
TO: "Interdisciplinary Thinking for AI-Era Careers"
```

#### Slide 9 (Equity) - Remove privilege language
```
CHANGE: "Access for All. Not Just the Privileged."
TO: "Access for All."

CHANGE: "Focusing on what you can do, not who you know."
TO: "Focus on what you can do. Unlock your potential."

OR consider: "Portfolios are the great equalizer."
```

#### Slide 10 (Team) - Reformat
```
For each team member:
1. Photo + Name
2. Role at SkaFld (bold)
3. Domain expertise (1 line)
4. Key credential (1 line, no dates)

Mike Belloli specific:
- Remove: dates from credentials
- Change: "Stanford DNA" → "Technology, Design, Policy"
- Update: UN SDG Fund → "Breakthrough Alliance Co-Chair"
```

#### Slide 11 (Ask) - Consider removing or simplifying
```
Discussion point: Since minimum award is $20K and top is $50K already,
the "ask" slide may be redundant.

OPTION A: Keep but frame as "How $50K enables leverage for larger funding"
OPTION B: Remove budget slide, end on Team + Closing
OPTION C: Keep but simplify to single statement
```

#### Footer Updates Throughout
```
CHANGE: "Farm System for Talent Development"
TO: Consider healthcare/human potential analogies
   Options: "Investment in Human Potential"
           "Rebuilding the Bridge to Careers"
           "Nurturing Human Potential"
```

### 3.2 New Slide: Pillars + Learning Science Combined

**Position:** After "Teach to Fish", before Platform

**Content:**
```markdown
## Our Pillars | Built on Learning Science

| Pillar | Description | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|----------|

| Near-Peer Mentorship | 12th→10th, 11th→9th grade pairing | Topping (2005): Teaching reinforces learning |
| Real Project Briefs | Situated cognition with real stakes | Lave & Wenger (1991): Authentic contexts transfer better |
| Responsible AI Practices | Hallucination detection, ethical use from day one | UNESCO (2021): Early guardrails prevent bad habits |
```

### 3.3 New Slide or Section: Human-Centered Design

**Add explicit section on HOW students learn human-centered design:**

```markdown
## Policy & Strategy Awareness

Students learn responsible AI deployment through:
- Understanding ethical and governance boundaries
- Seeing how AI projects align with organizational goals

## Part 6: Key Quotes to Use in Pitch

### From Stanford Accelerator
> "Accelerator Studio enables development and impact of research that improves learning."

**Our adaptation:**
> "AI Studio Teams enables development and impact of authentic practice that improves learning."

### Teach to Fish
> "Most AI education gives students prompts that expire in months. We teach metacognitive skills that transfer across any AI tool."

### Human-Centered
> "This program puts educators and learners at the heart of AI design—ensuring these tools expand access, agency, and connection."

### Portfolio Thesis
> "The solution is not to prepare students for entry-level positions that no longer exist. The solution is to help students demonstrate they do not need entry-level positions because they have already proven their capability through validated work."
