# Learning Science Foundation

## Evidence-Based Design

The El Segundo AI Academy curriculum is grounded in decades of research on effective instruction for underrepresented learners. Every design decision traces to empirical evidence.

## Stereotype Threat Research

### The Phenomenon

Claude Steele's seminal research (1995, 1997) demonstrated that awareness of negative stereotypes about one's group impairs performance. In computing contexts:

- Women performed worse on math tests when told the test "shows gender differences"
- The effect disappeared when the stereotype was not made salient
- Belonging interventions can neutralize stereotype threat effects

### Our Application

| Stereotype Threat Factor | Curriculum Response |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Numeric underrepresentation | 50/50 gender parity in all visible elements |
| Lack of role models | Required diverse guest speakers and examples |
| Masculine-coded environments | Girls-only spaces as opt-in alternative |
| Attribution to ability | Growth mindset framing throughout |
| Competitive evaluation | Collaborative assessment structures |

## Safe Space First Pattern

Research on girls in esports (AnyKey, 2019; Women in Games, 2021) reveals that girls-only programming produces dramatically better outcomes:

### Evidence Base

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| DreamHack Girls Initiative | 5x higher retention in girls-only leagues vs. mixed |
| Harvey Mudd CS Restructuring | Girls-only intro course contributed to 40% to 55% female CS majors |
| Carnegie Mellon Women@SCS | Single-gender mentoring circles improved persistence |
| Google CS First | Girls-only coding clubs showed higher completion rates |

### The Transition Model

Our curriculum implements a research-based progression:

1. **Safe Space Entry:** Girls-only or identity-affirming initial programming
2. **Skill Building:** Develop competence in supportive environment
3. **Confidence Development:** Experience success and peer validation
4. **Optional Transition:** Move to mixed-gender spaces when ready
5. **Continued Access:** Safe spaces remain available throughout

This model respects individual readiness while building toward integrated participation.

## Visible Role Model Research

Dasgupta's research (2011) demonstrates that visible role models significantly impact underrepresented students:

- **Exposure to female professors** increased women's implicit identification with math
- **Same-gender role models** improved STEM persistence by 3x
- **Effect was strongest** for students with initially weaker identification

### Our Implementation

- **Mandatory 50% female guest speakers** in all AI programming
- **Curriculum case studies** featuring diverse AI practitioners
- **Mentorship connections** to industry professionals matching student identities
- **Student showcases** highlighting diverse peer success stories

## Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

The CAST framework (2018) provides our accessibility foundation:

### Multiple Means of Engagement

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Optimize relevance | Connect AI concepts to student interests and communities |
| Minimize threats | Reduce anxiety through mastery-oriented assessment |
| Foster collaboration | Peer learning structures throughout |
| Develop self-assessment | Reflection tools for metacognitive development |

### Multiple Means of Representation

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Offer alternatives to visual | Audio descriptions, tactile models |
| Offer alternatives to auditory | Captions, transcripts, visual cues |
| Clarify vocabulary | AI terminology glossary with examples |
| Highlight patterns | Consistent structure across lessons |

### Multiple Means of Action & Expression

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Vary response methods | Written, verbal, visual, kinesthetic options |
| Optimize access to tools | Assistive technology compatibility |
| Guide goal-setting | Scaffolded project planning |
| Enhance capacity for monitoring | Progress tracking dashboards |

## Differentiated Instruction Research

Tomlinson's framework (2001) guides our approach to learner variability:

### Differentiation by Readiness

- **Tiered activities** with multiple entry points
- **Flexible pacing** through self-directed modules
- **Scaffolded complexity** building from concrete to abstract

### Differentiation by Interest

- **Choice in project topics** within AI application domains
- **Connection to student passions** (art, sports, social justice)
- **Career exploration** aligned with individual aspirations

### Differentiation by Learning Profile

- **Modality options** for instruction and assessment
- **Environmental preferences** (individual, pair, group work)
- **Cultural responsiveness** in examples and applications

## Cognitive Load Theory

Sweller's research (1988, 2019) informs our instructional design:

- **Reduce extraneous load:** Clear visual design, consistent navigation
- **Manage intrinsic load:** Concept sequencing from simple to complex
- **Optimize germane load:** Active learning activities that build schemas

### Application to AI Education

AI concepts involve high intrinsic complexity. We address this through:

1. **Unplugged activities** that isolate concepts from tool complexity
2. **Worked examples** showing complete solutions before practice
3. **Fading scaffolds** that gradually release responsibility
4. **Spaced practice** returning to concepts across grade levels

:::info Research Integration
Each curriculum module includes a "Research Foundation" section documenting the empirical basis for design decisions, enabling continuous validation and refinement.

## Measurement Alignment

Our assessment approach draws on assessment science:

- **Formative assessment** for ongoing feedback (Black & Wiliam, 1998)
- **Performance-based assessment** for authentic demonstration (Wiggins, 1989)
- **Portfolio assessment** for comprehensive competency evidence (Paulson et al., 1991)

These approaches are particularly effective for diverse learners, reducing bias inherent in standardized testing while providing richer evidence of learning.
