# Learning Science Foundation

## Evidence Base for the AI Champions Approach

The AI Champions Program synthesizes research from three domains: corporate reskilling, educational professional development, and adult learning theory. Each element of our design is grounded in evidence about what actually changes teacher practice.

## Research Foundation 1: The Failure of Traditional Professional Development

Decades of research on teacher professional development reveal a consistent pattern: traditional workshop models rarely produce sustained behavior change.

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Joyce & Showers (2002) | Only 5% of teachers implement new practices from workshops without follow-up coaching |
| Darling-Hammond et al. (2017) | Effective PD requires 50+ hours, active learning, and ongoing support |
| Kraft et al. (2018) | Coaching produces effect sizes 2-3x larger than workshop-only approaches |

**Design Implication:** The AI Champions model replaces one-time workshops with extended training (40 hours), ongoing peer coaching, and sustained mentorship relationships.

## Research Foundation 2: Near-Peer Learning Effectiveness

Research on peer learning consistently shows that learners often benefit more from slightly more advanced peers than from distant experts.

**Key Findings:**

- **Cognitive proximity**: Near-peers use similar mental models and vocabulary, reducing translation barriers (Topping, 2005)
- **Social proof**: Seeing a similar other succeed increases self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977)
- **Contextual relevance**: Peer mentors understand local constraints and opportunities (Lave & Wenger, 1991)
- **Reciprocal benefit**: Teaching others consolidates the mentor's own learning (Chi et al., 2001)

:::info Evidence from Practice
Corporate reskilling programs at companies like AT&T and IBM found that employees trained by recently-upskilled peers showed 40% higher retention of new skills compared to those trained by external consultants.
:::

**Design Implication:** AI Champions are not AI experts; they are colleagues who recently learned and can authentically relate to their mentees' anxieties and challenges.

## Research Foundation 3: Sandbox Learning Environments

Research on learning in high-stakes domains (aviation, medicine, military) demonstrates the power of graduated practice environments.

| Domain | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Aviation | Flight simulators reduce real-world errors by 70% through consequence-free practice |
| Medicine | Simulation-based training improves procedural skills with 50% fewer errors |
| Military | After-action reviews in training environments accelerate expertise development |

**The Psychology of Safe Failure:**

- Fear of public incompetence prevents experimentation (Edmondson, 1999)
- Low-stakes practice builds self-efficacy before high-stakes application (Bandura, 1997)
- Reflection on mistakes in safe contexts accelerates learning (Kolb, 1984)

**Design Implication:** Champions practice extensively in sandbox environments before classroom implementation. They experience success privately before performing publicly.

---

## Research Foundation 4: Sustained Practice Communities

Research on technology adoption in education shows that sustainability requires community, not just individual training.

**Communities of Practice Framework (Wenger, 1998):**

| Element | AI Champions Implementation |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Domain | AI integration in K-12 education |
| Community | Champions network with regular interaction |
| Practice | Shared lesson development and problem-solving |

**Key Findings:**

- Teachers with ongoing peer support show 3x higher implementation rates (Penuel et al., 2007)
- Professional learning communities outperform individual professional development (Vescio et al., 2008)
- Sustained practice change requires 12-18 months of supported implementation (Desimone, 2009)

**Design Implication:** The program creates permanent structures (Champions network, mentorship matching, lesson library) that outlast the grant period.

---

## Research Foundation 5: Subject-Specific Relevance

Generic technology training consistently underperforms discipline-specific approaches.

**Evidence:**

- Subject-specific professional development produces larger gains in student achievement (Kennedy, 1998)
- Teachers rate relevance as the primary factor in PD effectiveness (Garet et al., 2001)
- Transfer of learning is highly context-dependent (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999)

**Design Implication:** Champions train in discipline-specific cohorts (STEM, Humanities, Arts, Elementary) and develop subject-relevant applications immediately.

## Theoretical Integration: The AI Champions Learning Model

Our design integrates these research foundations into a coherent learning model:

```
                    SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT
                           |
                           v
    Selection -----> Intensive Training -----> Classroom Practice
       |                    |                        |
       v                    v                        v
    Peer-relatable      Subject-specific       Supported by
    Champions           cohorts               observation
       |                    |                        |
       v                    v                        v
    Near-peer -------> Mentorship -----------> Sustained
    credibility         preparation            community
```

This integrated approach addresses the multiple failure modes of traditional professional development while creating structures for sustainable, scalable impact.
