# AI Champions Teacher Training Program

## Stanford CREATE AI Challenge: Track 1 - Augment Teaching

**Submitted by:** Skafld Studio in partnership with El Segundo Unified School District

**Funding Request:** $50,000

**Project Duration:** 12 months

---

## Executive Summary

Teachers stand at the frontline of AI transformation, yet most lack the confidence and training to integrate AI tools into their practice. The **AI Champions Program** addresses this critical gap through a research-backed train-the-trainer model that transforms 20 early-adopter teachers into AI mentors who then train their colleagues.

Our approach draws from proven methodologies in corporate reskilling and military training: **sandbox before scale**. Rather than overwhelming faculty with generic AI workshops, we create safe experimentation environments where teachers discover AI applications relevant to their specific subjects and grade levels.

:::info Key Innovation
**Near-peer mentoring accelerates adoption.** Teachers learn best from colleagues who understand their daily challenges, not from external consultants who leave after a workshop.

### The Opportunity

El Segundo Unified School District serves 6,500+ students across six schools in a community anchored by aerospace, technology, and entertainment industries. This creates an ideal laboratory for AI education innovation:

- **Industry proximity** provides authentic use cases and employer validation
- **Manageable scale** enables rapid iteration and course correction
- **Strong community support** for educational innovation
- **Replicable model** for districts nationwide

### Program Outcomes

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| AI Champions trained | 20 teachers | Program completion |
| Confidence increase | 85%+ | Pre/post assessment |
| Colleagues mentored | 50+ teachers | Cohort 2 enrollment |
| AI-enhanced lessons | 100+ | Lesson library count |
| Sustained practice | 70%+ | 6-month follow-up |

### Why This Matters

The teacher confidence gap represents the primary bottleneck in K-12 AI adoption. District leaders report that:

- 78% of teachers express interest in AI but lack structured training
- 65% fear "looking incompetent" when using new tools
- 82% prefer learning from trusted colleagues over external experts

The AI Champions Program transforms this anxiety into agency, creating a sustainable culture of AI literacy that extends far beyond the grant period.
