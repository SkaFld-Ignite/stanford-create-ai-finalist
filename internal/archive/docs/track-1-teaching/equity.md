# Fairness, Equity, and Inclusion

## Design Principles for Equitable Access

The AI Champions Program embeds equity considerations throughout its design, ensuring that AI teaching capacity builds across all subjects, grade levels, and teacher demographics.

## Diverse Champion Recruitment

### Selection Criteria for Equity

| Dimension | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Subject distribution | All core + specials | AI belongs in every classroom, not just STEM |
| Grade level coverage | K-12 representation | Different developmental needs require different approaches |
| Gender balance | Reflect faculty composition | Counter AI as male-dominated field perception |
| Technology comfort | Range of starting points | Champions must be relatable to hesitant colleagues |
| School representation | All 6 schools | Prevent AI capacity concentration |

:::info Intentional Design
We actively recruit teachers who are **curious but not expert**. Champions who recently overcame their own AI anxiety are more effective mentors than those who never experienced it.

## Subject Inclusion: Beyond STEM

Traditional AI education initiatives concentrate in STEM departments, leaving humanities, arts, and elementary teachers without relevant training. Our program corrects this imbalance.

### Discipline-Specific Tracks

| Track | Champion Seats | Sample Applications |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| STEM | 5 teachers | Lab analysis, math tutoring, coding assistance |
| Humanities | 5 teachers | Writing feedback, research support, perspective-taking |
| Arts & CTE | 5 teachers | Creative tools, design iteration, media production |
| Elementary | 5 teachers | Reading support, story creation, adaptive practice |

Each track develops AI applications authentic to its discipline, preventing the reduction of AI education to "tech class" content.

## Accessibility in Training Design

### Universal Design Principles

All training materials and activities follow universal design for learning (UDL) principles:

- **Multiple means of engagement**: Choice in practice activities; varied participation modes
- **Multiple means of representation**: Visual, auditory, and text-based resources
- **Multiple means of action/expression**: Diverse ways to demonstrate learning

### Accommodation Practices

- Training sessions held at accessible times and locations
- Materials available in advance for preview
- Captioning and transcripts for video content
- Flexible pacing options for module completion

## Addressing AI Equity in Curriculum

Champions learn to recognize and address equity issues in AI tools themselves:

| Issue | Training Content |
|-------|-----------------|
| Algorithmic bias | Identifying and discussing bias in AI outputs |
| Access disparities | Strategies for varied student device/connectivity access |
| Digital literacy gaps | Scaffolding for students new to AI interaction |
| Cultural responsiveness | Ensuring AI applications respect diverse backgrounds |

## Mentorship Matching for Equity

Cohort 2 mentorship assignments consider equity factors:

- Schools with fewer tech resources receive Champion attention
- Subject areas historically excluded from technology PD are prioritized
- Teachers who express AI anxiety are matched with Champions who overcame similar concerns
