# Glossary of Terms and Key Concepts

| Term | Definition | Context / Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Access Equity** | Ensuring that all students have the hardware, software, and connectivity required to use AI tools. | Often contrasted with *Agency Equity* to show we move beyond simple usage. |
| **Agency Equity** | The capacity for learners to not only use AI, but to critically evaluate, shape, and critique the systems themselves. | A core strategic priority aligned with Stanford GSE's 2026 vision. |
| **AI Coach** | A Socratic decomposition engine within Trailhead that provides guidance through questioning rather than direct answers. | Prevents "prompt dependency" by forcing students to decompose problems. |
| **Catalyst vs. Crutch** | The conceptual debate over whether AI will replace critical thinking (crutch) or ignite it (catalyst). | The central framing for the SkaFld approach to AI in education. |
| **CRAFT Project** | A Stanford initiative (led by Victor Lee) focused on modular, subject-connected AI literacy resources. | Our modular implementation model is inspired by and aligned with CRAFT. |
| **Decomposition Thinking** | The process of breaking complex, multi-variable challenges into small, actionable "yes/no" decisions. | The first step in the SkaFld Ideation Methodology and AI Coach interaction. |
| **Domain Integration** | The practice of embedding specialized subject-matter expertise into AI-assisted workflows. | How teachers leverage their professional backgrounds to mentor students. |
| **Employer Portal** | A secure interface where industry partners view student work samples and provide professional validation. | The mechanism for converting student projects into employer-verified evidence. |
| **Epistemic Fluency** | The capacity to evaluate the nature, quality, and limitations of knowledge in an AI-augmented landscape. | Used to train students to be "critics" of AI-generated content and data. |
| **Expert-Led Learning** | A model where educators act as expert mentors rather than content deliverers, enabling high-level discovery. | Contrasts with "traditional instruction" to highlight the teacher's new role. |
| **HAS** | **Human Agency Scale.** A Stanford HAI framework for quantifying the desired level of human involvement in AI tasks. | We target the **H3 (Equal Partnership)** mode favored by the workforce. |
| **Implementation Science** | The study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings into routine educational practice. | Frames our El Segundo pilot as a rigorous, scalable validation exercise. |
| **Interdisciplinary Practice** | The synthesis of knowledge across diverse fields (e.g., tech, design, and policy) to solve complex problems. | Our methodology and team structure are built on this core principle. |
| **Micro-internship** | Short-term, paid, professional assignments (10–20 hours) completed by students for local employers. | The immediate "ROI" for students who demonstrate mastery through portfolios. |
| **Portfolio-Based Pathway** | A career bridge where evidence of capability (work samples) replaces traditional credentials (transcripts). | The fundamental "Bridge to Careers" that SkaFld builds for the AI era. |
| **Responsible AI** | The ethical deployment of AI, focusing on hallucination detection, bias recognition, and human dignity. | Taught through active judgment exercises rather than static rule sets. |
| **SkaFld Trailhead** | The AI-powered K-12 learning platform that facilitates coaching, decomposition, and employer validation. | The technological engine powering the partnership's educational model. |
| **Social Learning** | Developmental relationships where senior students mentor juniors, amplified by AI scaffolding. | Addresses the HAI finding that interpersonal skills are rising in demand. |
| **UDL** | **Universal Design for Learning.** A framework to improve teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights. | Used to ensure our platform is barrier-free (no coding/GPA prerequisites). |
| **Verified Evidence** | Documented proof of student capability that has been rated and validated by actual industry professionals. | The final output of the program that de-risks entry-level hiring. |
