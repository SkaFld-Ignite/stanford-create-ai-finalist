# Draft: Career Augmentation Presentation v2 - SkaFld Trailhead

## Section 1: The Agency-First Paradigm

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence necessitates a fundamental shift
from tool-based literacy to agency-first mastery. Stanford HAI research on the
Human Agency Scale (HAS) reveals that the most favored arrangement in the
workforce is an "Equal Partnership" (H3), preferred by 45.2% of occupations.
SkaFld Studio x Strategic Alignment is designed around this exact principle. We
position AI not as a replacement for human labor, but as a catalyst for critical
thinking. By integrating Socratic AI coaching, we ensure students remain the
primary drivers of the problem-solving process, aligning with the growing
demand for higher human agency in automated environments.

## Section 2: Rebuilding the Interpersonal Bridge

As AI systems assume greater responsibility for information-processing tasks,
the value of uniquely human capabilities is skyrocketing. Our model addresses
the shifting skill demands identified by Stanford researchers, moving away from
traditional data management toward interpersonal and organizational
coordination. Through our multi-grade peer-mentorship structure—where 12th
graders guide 10th graders—students develop the mentoring, resource monitoring,
and human interaction skills that now define workplace readiness in the AI era.
We are rebuilding the career bridge by focusing on the "Social Learning"
connections that AI cannot replicate.

## Section 3: Evidence-Based Implementation Science

Reflecting the methodology of the CRAFT Project led by Associate Professor
Victor Lee, our partnership utilizes a subject-connected, modular approach to
AI integration. Rather than isolating AI education into a standalone course,
our weekly 90-minute sessions are embedded within the El Segundo Unified
framework. This implementation model serves as a rigorous exercise in
Implementation Science, providing a scalable template for validating educational
effectiveness. We use disaggregated tracking and employer-rated scoring to
ensure our findings are rooted in evidence-based practice.

## Section 4: Epistemic Fluency & Discernment

Central to the SkaFld methodology is the development of Epistemic Fluency—the
capacity to evaluate and verify different types of knowledge in an
AI-augmented landscape. We move beyond simple prompt engineering to teach
decomposition thinking and cross-domain pattern recognition. In line with the
Dean's vision of students as "creators and critics," learners are trained to
be critics of AI outputs, developing the discernment necessary to detect
hallucinations and recognize ethical boundaries. By teaching students to
"Research Wide and Validate Narrow," we provide them with durable metacognitive
skills that persist even as individual AI tools become obsolete.

## Section 5: Agency Equity by Design

True fairness in the AI era requires moving beyond access equity to achieve
Agency Equity. We define Agency Equity as the capacity for learners to not
only use AI responsibly, but to critically evaluate, shape, and critique the
systems themselves. While traditional programs focus on who gets to use the
tool, our partnership focuses on who has the power to design and audit the
system. Our program incorporates GSE's strategic priority on equitable agency,
ensuring that students from all backgrounds—including first-generation college-
bound and socioeconomically diverse cohorts—learn to evaluate and critique AI
design. By utilizing portfolio-based pathways as "the great equalizer," we
shift the focus from pedigree to proven capability.

## Section 6: The 30-Second SkaFld Trailhead Pitch

SkaFld Trailhead is more than a platform; it’s a personalized AI coach that
builds student agency through discovery. Our adaptive learning paths
dynamically adjust complexity, providing real-time Socratic feedback that
forces critical thinking. We don’t just track deficiencies; we identify skill
gaps and map strengths directly to employer demand. The result is verified
evidence of mastery, giving students the ROI they need and employers the
guaranteed capability they now prioritize over traditional degrees.

**Call to Action:**
Support the El Segundo pilot as a scalable model for evidence-based
implementation science, bridging the gap between high school and the AI-era
workforce.
