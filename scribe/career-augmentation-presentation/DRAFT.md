# Draft: Career Augmentation Presentation - AI Studio Teams

## Section 1: The Agency-First Paradigm

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence necessitates a fundamental shift
from tool-based literacy to agency-first mastery. Stanford HAI research on the
Human Agency Scale (HAS) reveals that the most favored arrangement in the
workforce is an "Equal Partnership" (H3), preferred by 45.2% of occupations. AI
Studio Teams is designed around this exact principle. We position AI not as a
replacement for human labor, but as a catalyst for critical thinking. By
integrating Socratic AI coaching, we ensure students remain the primary drivers
of the problem-solving process, aligning with the growing demand for higher
human agency in automated environments.

## Section 2: Rebuilding the Interpersonal Bridge

As AI systems assume greater responsibility for information-processing tasks,
the value of uniquely human capabilities is skyrocketing. Our model addresses the
shifting skill demands identified by Stanford researchers, moving away from
traditional data management toward interpersonal and organizational coordination.
Through our multi-grade peer-mentorship structure—where 12th graders guide 10th
graders—students develop the mentoring, resource monitoring, and human
interaction skills that now define workplace readiness in the AI era. We are
rebuilding the career bridge by focusing on the "Social Learning" connections
that AI cannot replicate.

## Section 3: Modular Integration & Subject-Connectivity

Reflecting the methodology of the CRAFT Project led by Associate Professor Victor
Lee, AI Studio Teams utilizes a subject-connected, modular approach to AI
integration. Rather than isolating AI education into a standalone course, our
weekly 90-minute sessions are embedded within the El Segundo Unified framework.
This ensures that AI literacy remains contextually relevant, allowing students
to engage with these tools as users, developers, and critics across diverse
business simulations. This implementation model serves as a rigorous exercise
in Implementation Science, providing a scalable template for validating
educational effectiveness in diverse school districts.

## Section 4: Epistemic Fluency & Discernment

Central to the SkaFld methodology is the development of Epistemic Fluency—the
capacity to evaluate and verify different types of knowledge in an
AI-augmented landscape. We move beyond simple prompt engineering to teach
decomposition thinking and cross-domain pattern recognition. Students are
trained to be "critics" of AI outputs, developing the discernment necessary to
detect hallucinations and recognize ethical boundaries. By teaching students to
"Research Wide and Validate Narrow," we provide them with durable metacognitive
skills that persist even as individual AI tools become obsolete.

## Section 5: Agency Equity by Design

True fairness in the AI era requires moving beyond access equity to achieve
Agency Equity—defined here as the capacity for learners to not only use AI
responsibly, but to critically evaluate, shape, and critique the systems
themselves. While traditional programs focus on who gets to use the tool, AI
Studio Teams focuses on who has the power to design and audit the system. Our
program incorporates GSE's strategic priority on equitable agency, ensuring
that students from all backgrounds—including first-generation college-bound and
socioeconomically diverse cohorts—learn to evaluate and critique AI design. By
utilizing portfolio-based pathways as "the great equalizer," we shift the focus
from pedigree to proven capability, ensuring that every student can shape the
responsible AI solutions of the future.
