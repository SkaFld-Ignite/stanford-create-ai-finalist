# Critique Report

*   **Lens Applied:** Academic (Stanford GSE/HAI Focus)
*   **Overall Score:** A-

## Executive Summary
The draft successfully incorporates high-level terminology and strategic
priorities from Stanford GSE and HAI. It demonstrates a strong understanding of
the shift from simple AI literacy to agency-first mastery, positioning the
project well within the "Implementation Science" framework valued by the GSE.

## Major Issues (Requires Fixes)
*   **Explicit Agency Equity Definition:** While Section 5 mentions "Agency
    Equity," it lacks a formal definition that distinguishes it from "Access
    Equity" in a way that matches the GSE strategic priority. The draft claims
    to "incorporate GSE's strategic priority," but could more clearly state that
    Agency Equity is the capacity for students to *shape and critique* AI
    systems, not just use them responsibly.
*   **Evidence-Based Implementation Science:** Section 3 references the CRAFT
    Project and Victor Lee but does not explicitly frame the El Segundo pilot as
    an exercise in "Implementation Science." The GSE priorities (RESEARCH.md)
    specifically advocate for implemention science to validate effectiveness.
    Adding this specific phrase would strengthen the academic alignment.

## Minor Suggestions (Optional Improvements)
*   **Epistemic Fluency Context:** Section 4 introduces "Epistemic Fluency"
    excellently. A minor improvement would be to explicitly link this to the
    Dean's quote in RESEARCH.md about students being "creators and critics."
*   **Mentorship Specificity:** Section 2 mentions peer-mentorship but could
    briefly note that this addresses the "shrinking demand for
    information-processing" by prioritizing "interpersonal strengths," as
    noted in the HAI research.

## Adherence Checks
*   **Fact-Check (RESEARCH.md):** Pass (Correctly cites HAS preference and
    CRAFT methodology).
*   **Scope-Check (BLUEPRINT.md):** Pass (Adheres to all five planned sections).
*   **Style-Check (styleguide.md):** Not Applicable (No styleguide.md found).
