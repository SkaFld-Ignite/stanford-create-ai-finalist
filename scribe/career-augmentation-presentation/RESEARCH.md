# Research Dossier: Career Augmentation Presentation

## Executive Summary
*   **Human-Centered AI Focus:** Stanford GSE and HAI prioritize AI that augments rather than replaces human capability. The proposal should emphasize student **agency** and **interpersonal coordination**.
*   **Human Agency Scale (HAS):** Stanford research identifies a preference for "Equal Partnership" (H3) or "Human-Led" (H4) AI involvement. AI Studio Teams aligns with this by positioning AI as a coach/catalyst rather than an automator.
*   **Modular Integration (CRAFT):** Victor Lee’s initiative favors integrating AI literacy into existing curricula. Highlighting our "weekly 90-minute sessions" within the ESUSD framework mirrors this "subject-connected" approach.
*   **Interpersonal Over Information-Processing:** Demand is shifting from data management to human interaction. Our peer-mentorship model (12th -> 10th grade) directly addresses this GSE priority.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Human Agency Scale (HAS)
*   **Detail:** Stanford HAI research introduced HAS to quantify desired human involvement. The most favored arrangement is **Equal Partnership (H3)** (45.2% of occupations). Workers desire higher agency than experts deem necessary.

### 2. Subject-Connected AI Literacy (CRAFT Project)
*   **Detail:** Associate Professor Victor Lee’s CRAFT project provides modular, classroom-ready resources for high schoolers. It emphasizes that students should engage as users, developers, and **critics** of AI.

### 3. Shifting Skill Demands
*   **Detail:** Demand for traditional "information-processing" skills is shrinking, replaced by demand for **interpersonal and organizational skills** (coordination, mentoring, resource monitoring).

### 4. Evidence-Based Implementation
*   **Detail:** GSE advocates for "Implementation Science" and rigorous evaluation. Our disaggregated tracking (equity monitoring) and employer-rated scoring (rubric) align with this call for measurable impact.

## Technical Context & Constraints
*   **Alignment:** AI Studio Teams should use the term "Epistemic Fluency" (the capacity to evaluate different types of knowledge) as it is a GSE keyword.
*   **Constraint:** Ensure we distinguish "Agency Equity" (capacity to shape AI) from simple "Access Equity" (using the tool).

## Raw Notes / Snippets
*   "Students should learn to be not just consumers of AI, but creators and critics." - Dan Schwartz, Dean of GSE.
*   "The best solution to your problem likely exists in a field you've never explored." - SkaFld Methodology (UPF).
*   "Equal partnership (H3) is the preferred mode for nearly half of all tasks." - HAS Scale.
