# Blueprint: Career Augmentation Presentation

## 1. Objective
*   Refine the AI Studio Teams presentation to perfectly align with Stanford
    GSE and HAI's 2026 strategic priorities, specifically focusing on human
    agency and interpersonal coordination.

## 2. Target Audience
*   The Stanford CREATE AI Challenge judging committee, consisting of Stanford
    GSE faculty, HAI researchers, and educational technology experts who
    value human-centered design and evidence-based implementation.

## 3. Core Sections (Outline)

*   ### Section 1: The Agency-First Paradigm
    *   **Key Point:** Frame AI as a catalyst for human agency rather than a
        replacement for human labor.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Human Agency Scale (HAS) H3 - Equal Partnership
        preference. (Source: RESEARCH.md)

*   ### Section 2: Rebuilding the Interpersonal Bridge
    *   **Key Point:** Emphasize the shift from information-processing to
        interpersonal and organizational skills.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Shifting skill demands research from Stanford HAI.

*   ### Section 3: Modular Integration & Subject-Connectivity
    *   **Key Point:** Highlight the implementation model's alignment with
        modular, subject-connected AI literacy.
    *   **Supporting Data:** CRAFT Project methodology (Victor Lee). (Source:
        RESEARCH.md)

*   ### Section 4: Epistemic Fluency & Discernment
    *   **Key Point:** Position students as "critics" of AI through the SkaFld
        methodology.
    *   **Supporting Data:** GSE's focus on epistemic fluency and AI
        discernment. (Source: RESEARCH.md)

*   ### Section 5: Agency Equity by Design
    *   **Key Point:** Distinguish agency equity (capacity to shape) from
        access equity (capacity to use).
    *   **Supporting Data:** GSE strategic priority on equitable access and
        agency. (Source: RESEARCH.md)

## 4. Special Requirements
*   **Tone:** Academic yet visionary; Stanford-aligned professional.
*   **Keywords:** Epistemic Fluency, Human Agency Scale (HAS), Agency Equity,
    CRAFT Project, Interdisciplinary.
*   **Call to Action:** Support the El Segundo pilot as a scalable model for
    evidence-based implementation science.
