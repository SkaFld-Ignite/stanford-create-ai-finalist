# AI Studio Teams: Pitch Deck

**Stanford CREATE AI Challenge | February 10, 2026**

---

## Slide 1: The Entry-Level Job Crisis

### A 4-Year Window to Act

**AI Studio Teams**
Portfolio-Based Pathways to AI-Era Careers

*Stanford CREATE AI Challenge | Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities*

**Team:**
- Charles Sims, Project Director | SkaFld Studio
- Keith Coleman, Strategic Partnerships | Stanford GSE Scholar

**Funding Request: $50,000**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Entry-Level Jobs Are Disappearing

| Indicator | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **40%** of employers plan workforce reductions due to AI | World Economic Forum, 2024 |
| **50%** reduction in tech entry-level roles since 2019 | LinkedIn Workforce Report |
| **80%** of hiring managers predict cuts to internships | Intelligent.com Survey, 2024 |

### The Experience Paradox

```
Traditional: Education → Entry-Level Job → Experience → Career

Reality:    Education → [NO ENTRY POINTS] → ? → Career Stagnation
```

**Students entering high school today will graduate into a workforce where traditional entry points no longer exist.**

---

## Slide 3: The Insight

### "Give them the fish" vs. "Teach them to fish"

Most AI training programs give students prompts, templates, and tool tutorials—**the fish**.

We teach students **how to think** about AI problems—**the fishing skill**.

| Traditional AI Training | SkaFld Approach |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| "Here's how to use ChatGPT" | "Here's how to THINK about problems" |
| Tool-specific prompts | Decomposition methodology |
| Feature demonstrations | Cross-domain pattern recognition |
| Copy-paste workflows | Meta-cognitive skill building |

**The foundational shift in mindset must come before the tools can be used effectively.**

---

## Slide 4: Solution Overview

### AI Studio Teams: Three Pillars

**1. Portfolio Over Credentials**
- Students build employer-validated work samples
- Not just grades—documented capability proof
- Minimum 7.0/10 quality rating for certification

**2. Near-Peer Mentorship**
- 12th graders mentor 10th graders
- 11th graders mentor 9th graders
- Sustainable knowledge transfer as seniors graduate

**3. Employer Integration**
- Real project briefs from local companies
- Quarterly portfolio review panels
- Micro-internship pathways (10-20 paid hours)

### The Model
- 8 teams of 12 students = 96 total
- Weekly 90-minute sessions with teacher mentors
- 12 employer partners providing real projects

---

## Slide 5: The SkaFld Way

### Teaching How to Think, Not Just Tools

**The SkaFld Ideation Methodology**

> "The best solution to your problem probably exists in a field you've never explored. It is your job to find it, translate it, and prove it."

**Core Principles:**

1. **Research Wide, Validate Narrow**
   - Look outside your domain first
   - Study how other fields solved similar problems
   - Translate patterns, then validate

2. **Decomposition Thinking**
   - Break complex challenges into yes/no decisions
   - Foundation for effective AI collaboration
   - Actionable steps, not vague goals

3. **Cross-Domain Translation**
   - Interdisciplinary pattern recognition
   - Skills that transfer across any AI tool
   - Aligned with Stanford's interdisciplinary mission

---

## Slide 6: SkafldSpark Platform

### Technology Infrastructure for Scale

**SkafldSpark** is an AI-powered K-12 learning platform powering AI Studio Teams.

| Feature | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sparky AI Assistant** | Project coaching, decomposition guidance |
| **Activity Builder** | Teacher-created structured activities |
| **Portfolio Library** | Student work archive + employer review |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Progress tracking, at-risk identification |
| **Gamification** | Badges, streaks, skill levels |
| **Safety & Compliance** | COPPA/FERPA ready, content moderation |

### Why Platform Matters

- **Scalability**: Districts implement with SkaFld support
- **Sustainability**: Not dependent on our direct facilitation
- **Compliance**: Built for K-12 educational requirements
- **Engagement**: Gamified learning drives participation

---

## Slide 7: El Segundo Advantage

### The Ideal Implementation Environment

**El Segundo Unified School District**
- 5 schools, 3,400 students
- Compact district enables tight coordination

**Major Employer Concentration**
- Boeing, Northrop Grumman (aerospace)
- Technology company headquarters
- Entertainment industry leaders
- **Walking distance** from high school

**Why This Matters**
- Authentic employer partnerships
- Real project opportunities
- Micro-internship accessibility
- Model replicable to other compact districts

---

## Slide 8: Learning Science Foundation

### Research-Backed Approach

**Situated Learning** (Lave & Wenger, 1991)
> Learning embedded in authentic practice transfers better than classroom instruction

**Work Sample Validity** (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998)
> Work samples predict job performance far better than credentials

**Near-Peer Teaching** (Topping, 2005; Lockspeiser et al., 2008)
> "Learning by teaching" effect + social congruence optimizes mentorship

**AI Literacy** (Long & Magerko, 2020)
> Critical evaluation is a core competency for AI collaboration

**Human-Centered Design** (UNESCO, 2021)
> Ethical frameworks must be embedded from the start

## Slide 9: Outcomes & Equity

### Measurable Impact

| Metric | Year 1 Target |
|--------|---------------|
| Students with employer-validated portfolios | 96 (8 teams × 12) |
| Employer partners providing real projects | 12 companies |
| Micro-internship placements | 24 students (25%) |
| Portfolio quality score (employer-rated) | 7.0/10 minimum |
| Post-graduation employment (seniors) | 50% within 6 months |

### Equity by Design

| Dimension | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Gender parity | 50/50 ratio |
| Socioeconomic diversity | 40% FRL-eligible |
| First-generation students | 30% first-gen college |
| Prerequisites | **None required** |

**No coding prerequisites. No equipment requirements. No application essays.**

Portfolios reduce hiring bias (Goldin & Rouse, 2000)—we're building that advantage early.

## Key Messages for Q&A

### On Human-Centered Design
> "This program puts educators and learners at the heart of AI design—ensuring these tools expand access, agency, and connection rather than replacing the human relationships essential to learning."

### On Differentiation
> "We're not teaching AI tools. We're teaching how to THINK about AI problems. The foundational mindset shift must come before the tools can be used effectively."

### On Interdisciplinary Approach
> "The best solution to your problem probably exists in a field you've never explored. This cross-domain thinking mirrors the interdisciplinary approach Stanford champions."

### On Policy & Strategy
> "Policy awareness helps students understand ethical, legal, and governance boundaries. Strategy helps AI projects align with organizational goals. Together, they enable responsible design and human-centric strategic thinking."
