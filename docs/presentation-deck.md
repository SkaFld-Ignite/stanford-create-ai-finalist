# AI Studio Teams: Finalist Pitch Deck

**Event:** Stanford CREATE+AI Challenge Finals
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Presenter:** Charles Sims, Mike Belloli, Keith Coleman

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Visual:** High-quality image of a diverse group of high school students collaborating around a screen, overlaid with the "SkaFld Spark" logo and Stanford CREATE+AI branding.

**Headline:** AI Studio Teams: Portfolio-Based Pathways to AI-Era Careers

**Sub-headline:** Building the Farm System for Talent Development in the Age of AI.

**Footer:** Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities | Funding Request: $50,000

---

## Slide 2: The Crisis (The "Why Now")
**Visual:** A simple, stark line graph showing the plummeting number of entry-level jobs vs. rising AI adoption.

**Headline:** The Entry-Level Job is Disappearing.

**Key Stats:**
- **40%** of employers plan workforce reductions due to AI (WEF, 2024).
- **Over 45%** reduction in tech entry-level roles since 2019.
- **78%** of hiring managers predict AI will displace recent graduates (Intelligent.com).

**Narrative:** "We are facing a crisis not of capability, but of access. The traditional 'credential-to-career' pipeline is broken because the entry-level jobs that used to provide training are being automated away."

---

## Slide 3: The Gap (Why Current Solutions Fail)
**Visual:** Split screen. Left side: "The Fish" (chaotic pile of prompts, tools, tutorials). Right side: "The Fishing Pole" (Structured thinking process).

**Headline:** We Teach Tools. We Need to Teach Thinking.

**Text:**
- **Current Approach:** "Here is a prompt for ChatGPT." (Brittle, expires quickly)
- **Our Approach:** "Here is how to decompose a complex problem." (Durable, transfers across tools)

**Narrative:** "Most programs give students the fish—specific prompts and tools. We teach them to fish. We focus on the metacognitive skills that come *before* the prompt."

---

## Slide 4: The Solution (SkaFld Spark)
**Visual:** Three interlocking gears or layers forming a pyramid.

**Headline:** SkaFld Spark: A Platform for Verified Capability

**The 3-Layer Architecture:**
1.  **Foundation (Weeks 1-4):** Learning to Decompose. (The "SkaFld Ideation Methodology")
2.  **Application (Weeks 5-8):** AI-Coached Challenges. (Socratic questioning, not answers)
3.  **Demonstration (Weeks 9-12):** Employer-Validated Portfolios. (Real projects, real feedback)

**Narrative:** "SkaFld Spark is a learning platform that moves students from foundational thinking to applied AI capability, ending with a portfolio that proves they can do the work."

---

## Slide 5: Platform Demo (The "Magic")
**Visual:** [VIDEO/GIF PLACEHOLDER] A student dashboard showing the "Sparky" AI coach asking a decomposition question: *"That's a big goal. What are the first three decisions you need to make to get there?"*

**Headline:** AI as a Coach, Not a Crutch.

**Feature Highlight:**
- **Socratic Engine:** Guides thinking rather than providing answers.
- **Progress Tracking:** Measures "decomposition" skill, not just task completion.
- **Portfolio Builder:** Auto-compiles project artifacts into a professional view.

## Slide 6: Learning Science (The "Why It Works")
**Visual:** Icons representing the three scientific pillars, with citations in small print.

**Headline:** Built on Validated Learning Science

1.  **Project-Based Learning (Situated Cognition):** Learning in authentic contexts (Lave & Wenger).
2.  **Near-Peer Mentorship:** Seniors mentor Sophomores; Juniors mentor Freshmen (Topping, 2005).
3.  **Portfolio Assessment:** Work samples predict performance 5x better than grades (Schmidt & Hunter).

**Narrative:** "We aren't guessing. We are combining three of the most robust findings in learning science—PBL, near-peer mentoring, and portfolio assessment—into a single scalable platform."

---

## Slide 7: The Methodology (Differentiation)
**Visual:** A diagram of the "SkaFld Ideation Methodology": Research Wide -> Decompose -> Translate -> Validate.

**Headline:** The "SkaFld Way" of Interdisciplinary Thinking

**Core Principle:** "Research Wide, Validate Narrow."
- Students learn to look **across domains** for solutions.
- Inspired by the interdisciplinary innovation models of Stanford's d.school and engineering programs.

**Narrative:** "Our secret sauce isn't the software; it's the methodology. We teach students to think like engineers and designers, using AI to accelerate their execution."

---

## Slide 8: Traction (El Segundo Pilot)
**Visual:** Map of El Segundo with logos of partners (Boeing, Northrop Grumman, etc.) and a "Pilot Launching" badge.

**Headline:** Proof of Concept: El Segundo Unified

**The Metrics (Year 1):**
- **96 Students** (8 Teams of 12)
- **12 Employer Partners** (Aerospace, Tech, Media)
- **12-Month** Integrated Program
- **Goal:** 24 Paid Micro-Internships

**Narrative:** "We are starting in the most dense aerospace and tech corridor in the country. El Segundo is our lab to prove this model works before we scale."

---

## Slide 9: Equity by Design
**Visual:** A diverse team of students working on a tablet.

**Headline:** Access for All, Not Just the Privileged.

**Targets:**
- **50%** Female/Male Ratio.
- **40%** Free/Reduced Lunch.
- **No Prerequisites:** No coding, no GPA hurdles.
- **No Equipment Needed:** Everything provided in-session.

**Narrative:** "Portfolios are the great equalizer. By focusing on *what you can do* rather than *who you know*, we level the playing field for first-generation and underrepresented students."

---

## Slide 10: The Team
**Visual:** Photos of Charles, Keith, and Mike.

**Headline:** The Right Team to Execute

- **Charles Sims (Project Director):** Tech transformation leader (LA Clippers, UTA). Expert in workforce systems.
- **Keith Coleman (Stanford Liaison):** Stanford BA '86, mediaX Advisory Scholar. Deep ties to Stanford GSE and Angels.
- **Mike Belloli (Technology):** Full-stack architect building the SkaFld Spark platform.

## Slide 11: Vision & Ask
**Visual:** A roadmap graphic: "El Segundo" -> "California" -> "National Model".

**Headline:** The Launchpad for a National Model

**The Ask: $50,000 (Top Prize)**
- **40%** Platform Dev (SkaFld Spark AI Engine)
- **24%** Pilot Implementation
- **16%** Assessment & Research
- **20%** Ops & Team

**Success Definition:** "In 12 months, we won't just have a successful pilot; we will have a scalable SaaS platform ready for district adoption nationwide."
