# Solution: The AI Champions Train-the-Trainer Program

## Program Overview

The AI Champions Program transforms 20 early-adopter teachers into confident AI practitioners and peer mentors through a structured 40-hour intensive training, followed by a supported mentorship phase where they train 50+ additional colleagues.

### Core Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Sandbox before scale** | All training occurs in low-stakes practice environments before classroom application |
| **Near-peer mentoring** | Teachers learn from colleagues who share their context and challenges |
| **Subject-specific cohorts** | Champions grouped by discipline for relevant, transferable learning |
| **Sustained support** | Ongoing mentor relationships replace one-time workshops |
| **Evidence-based design** | Training methodology draws from corporate reskilling research |

## Program Structure

### Phase 1: Champion Selection (Month 1)

We recruit 20 AI Champions through a nomination and application process designed to identify teachers who are:

- **Curious but not expert** - We seek learners, not existing AI enthusiasts
- **Respected by peers** - Social influence matters for adoption cascade
- **Diverse in discipline** - Coverage across subjects and grade levels
- **Committed to mentorship** - Willingness to train colleagues after their own learning

:::tip Selection Criteria
We intentionally recruit teachers who represent the "early majority," not just early adopters. Champions must be relatable to colleagues who feel anxious about AI.

### Phase 2: Intensive Training (Months 2-3)

Champions complete 40 hours of hands-on training organized in four modules:

**Module 1: AI Foundations & Mindset (10 hours)**
- Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- Ethical frameworks for educational AI use
- Building psychological safety for experimentation
- Hands-on exploration of major AI tools

**Module 2: Subject-Specific Applications (12 hours)**
- Discipline-focused cohort sessions (STEM, Humanities, Arts, Elementary)
- Developing AI-enhanced lesson plans for immediate use
- Peer teaching within cohorts
- Building a personal AI teaching toolkit

**Module 3: Pedagogy of AI Integration (10 hours)**
- When AI helps vs. hinders learning objectives
- Scaffolding student AI literacy through teacher modeling
- Assessment strategies for AI-assisted work
- Managing classroom AI dynamics

**Module 4: Mentorship Preparation (8 hours)**
- Adult learning principles for peer training
- Facilitating safe experimentation environments
- Addressing colleague concerns and resistance
- Building sustainable practice communities

### Phase 3: Classroom Application & Refinement (Months 4-6)

Champions implement AI-enhanced lessons in their own classrooms with structured support:

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Implement first AI-enhanced lesson with observation support |
| 3-4 | Peer feedback sessions within Champion cohort |
| 5-6 | Iterate and document successful approaches |
| 7-8 | Begin informal peer sharing with interested colleagues |
| 9-12 | Develop training materials for Cohort 2 |

### Phase 4: Cohort 2 Mentorship (Months 7-10)

Each Champion mentors 2-3 colleagues through a condensed training program:

- **20-hour accelerated training** adapted from Champion curriculum
- **Weekly check-ins** between mentor and mentee
- **Cross-cohort learning sessions** bringing all mentees together
- **Lesson co-development** with Champion support

### Phase 5: Sustainability & Scale (Months 11-12)

The final phase establishes permanent structures for ongoing AI professional development:

- **AI Champions network** with regular meetings and shared resources
- **Lesson library** of AI-enhanced curriculum materials
- **Mentorship matching system** for new teachers
- **Annual Champion certification** process for continuous growth

## The Sandbox Approach

Central to our methodology is the "sandbox before scale" principle: all learning occurs in low-stakes practice environments before high-stakes classroom application.

**Sandbox Components:**

| Environment | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| AI Playground sessions | Explore tools without curriculum pressure |
| Mock lesson development | Practice designing with peer feedback |
| Simulation teaching | Try lessons with Champion colleagues as "students" |
| Observed implementation | Real classroom use with supportive observation |
| Reflection circles | Process challenges in psychologically safe groups |

This graduated approach addresses the psychological safety deficit that prevents many teachers from experimenting with AI. By the time Champions use AI tools with actual students, they have already succeeded multiple times in lower-stakes contexts.

## Differentiated Training Tracks

To address the relevance gap in generic AI training, Champions participate in discipline-specific cohorts:

| Track | Focus Areas | Sample Applications |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **STEM** | Computational thinking, data analysis, scientific modeling | AI-assisted lab report feedback, math problem generation |
| **Humanities** | Writing support, research, primary source analysis | Essay revision partners, historical perspective generation |
| **Arts** | Creative AI tools, artistic expression, digital media | AI art exploration, music composition assistance |
| **Elementary** | Age-appropriate AI introduction, foundational literacy | Story co-creation, adaptive reading support |
