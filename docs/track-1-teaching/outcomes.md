# Outcomes & Measurement Plan

## Theory of Change

Our theory of change connects program activities to measurable outcomes at teacher, classroom, and system levels:

```
IF we train 20 Champions with intensive, subject-specific AI training
AND they practice in sandbox environments before classroom implementation
AND they mentor 50+ colleagues using near-peer learning principles
THEN teacher AI confidence will increase by 85%+
AND AI-enhanced lesson use will become sustainable practice
AND the model will demonstrate replicability for other districts
```

## Primary Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Teacher AI Confidence

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Tool |
|--------|----------|--------|------------------|
| AI self-efficacy score | Pre-training survey | 85% increase | Validated TPACK-AI instrument |
| AI anxiety reduction | Pre-training survey | 60% decrease | Technology anxiety scale |
| Willingness to experiment | Pre-training survey | 90%+ "agree" | Custom survey items |

**Measurement Schedule:**
- Pre-training baseline (Month 1)
- Post-intensive training (Month 3)
- Post-classroom implementation (Month 6)
- Post-mentorship completion (Month 10)
- Sustainability check (Month 12)

### Outcome 2: AI-Enhanced Teaching Practice

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| AI-enhanced lessons developed | 100+ total | Lesson library count |
| Champions using AI weekly | 90%+ | Self-report survey |
| Cohort 2 teachers using AI weekly | 70%+ | Self-report survey |
| Observed AI integration quality | "Effective" rating | Rubric-based observation |

**Observation Protocol:**
Each Champion receives two formal observations of AI-integrated lessons using a validated rubric assessing:
- Pedagogical appropriateness of AI use
- Student engagement during AI-enhanced activities
- Teacher facilitation of AI-human interaction
- Alignment with learning objectives

### Outcome 3: Mentorship Effectiveness

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cohort 2 completion rate | 85%+ | Program records |
| Mentee satisfaction | 4.0+/5.0 | Post-program survey |
| Mentor effectiveness rating | 4.0+/5.0 | Mentee evaluation |
| Mentee continued practice | 70%+ at 6 months | Follow-up survey |

## Secondary Outcomes

### Sustainability Indicators

| Indicator | Target | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Champions network active | Monthly meetings | Attendance records |
| Lesson library growth | 20+ new lessons/month | Repository analytics |
| Spontaneous peer sharing | Documented instances | Observation notes |
| District commitment | Continued support | Written commitment |

### Replicability Indicators

| Indicator | Target | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Model documentation | Complete playbook | Deliverable review |
| Other district interest | 3+ inquiries | Communication records |
| Adaptation guidance | Documented | Playbook section |
| Cost model validated | Accurate projections | Budget reconciliation |

## Measurement Instruments

### AI Teaching Self-Efficacy Scale (ATSES)

A validated instrument adapted from existing technology self-efficacy measures, including items such as:

- *"I can effectively integrate AI tools into my lesson planning"*
- *"I feel confident troubleshooting when AI tools don't work as expected"*
- *"I can help students understand when AI assistance is appropriate"*

### AI Classroom Integration Rubric (ACIR)

An observation tool rating AI integration on four dimensions:

| Dimension | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| **Appropriateness** | AI use aligns with learning objectives; task is suitable for AI assistance |
| **Facilitation** | Teacher guides student-AI interaction effectively; addresses AI limitations |
| **Engagement** | Students are actively involved; AI enhances rather than replaces thinking |
| **Critical Use** | Teacher models critical evaluation of AI outputs; promotes student discernment |

### Program Quality Indicators

Formative assessment data collected throughout:
- Session attendance and engagement
- Module completion and assessment scores
- Participant feedback surveys after each training module
- Mentor-mentee interaction logs

## Data Collection Timeline

| Month | Data Collection Activities |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Baseline surveys (Champions) |
| 3 | Post-training surveys; Module assessments |
| 6 | Observation 1; Mid-point surveys; Lesson library audit |
| 8 | Cohort 2 baseline surveys |
| 10 | Observation 2; Post-mentorship surveys |
| 12 | Final surveys all participants; Sustainability indicators; Program evaluation |

## Analysis Plan

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Paired t-tests for pre-post confidence measures
- Descriptive statistics for program completion and satisfaction
- Correlation analysis between training engagement and outcomes

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Thematic coding of open-ended survey responses
- Case studies of high-impact Champions
- Focus groups with Cohort 2 participants

**Reporting:**
- Quarterly progress reports to Stanford
- Mid-point evaluation report (Month 6)
- Final comprehensive evaluation (Month 12)
- Replication playbook with evidence synthesis
