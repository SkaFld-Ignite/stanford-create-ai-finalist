- AI tool subscriptions for training environments
- Curriculum materials development
- Lesson library platform
- Reference resources and guides

### Facilitator Compensation ($12,000)

Covers:
- Lead facilitator for program coordination and Module 1/4 delivery
- Four discipline cohort leads for Module 2 subject-specific sessions

## Leveraged Resources

The Stanford CREATE AI grant leverages significant additional investment:

| Resource | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Champion release time | $15,000 | District contribution |
| Facilities for training | $3,000 | District contribution |
| Technology infrastructure | $5,000 | Existing district systems |
| Administrative support | $4,000 | District contribution |
| **Total Leveraged** | **$27,000** | |

:::info Total Project Investment
$50,000 (Stanford) + $27,000 (District) = **$77,000 total project value**

## Sustainability Plan

### Year 2 and Beyond

The AI Champions Program is designed for self-sustaining operation after the grant period:

| Element | Sustainability Mechanism |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Champions network | Volunteer leadership with district meeting support |
| Lesson library | District-hosted platform with community contributions |
| New teacher training | Champions integrate AI orientation into existing onboarding |
| Annual Champion cohort | District professional development budget allocation |
| Mentorship matching | Informal peer connection facilitated by department chairs |

### District Commitment

El Segundo USD has committed to:
- Continuing Champion stipends for future cohorts ($10,000/year)
- Hosting and maintaining the lesson library platform
- Integrating AI Champions into the district PD calendar
- Supporting Champion network meetings and collaboration

### Cost-Effectiveness

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost per Champion trained | $2,500 |
| Cost per Cohort 2 teacher trained | $500 (mentorship only) |
| Cost per AI-enhanced lesson developed | $500 |
| Year 2+ marginal cost per teacher | $200 (materials only) |

The train-the-trainer model dramatically reduces per-teacher costs after the initial investment, making district-wide AI literacy economically sustainable.
