## Challenge framework and judging priorities

Stanford's Accelerator for Learning designed the Create+AI Challenge around a provocative reframing: "Too often, AI in education is used for automation. We ask a fundamentally different question—**how can AI augment human potential?**"

The **$400,000 prize pool** breaks down into two $50,000 top awards per track (six total) plus additional $10,000-$20,000 awards. Your track selection signals strategic intent:

**Augment Teaching** prioritizes solutions addressing teacher pain points—particularly those enabling or enhancing social relationships with students. This track resonates strongest with judges Karen Cator (former Department of Education), Shelley Goldman (Stanford faculty), and Claudio Sassaki (teacher-centric Geekie founder).

**Augment Learning** emphasizes AI tools fostering participation among learners with disabilities, learning differences, or limited educational resources. Judges Maia Sharpley, Andre Bennin, and Karen Cator specifically champion underserved population access.

**Augment Career Opportunities** targets AI supporting skill-building, mentorship, and pathways to meaningful work. Andre Bennin's entire investment thesis at Rethink Education centers on education-to-employment pathways.
