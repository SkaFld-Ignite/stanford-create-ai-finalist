# AI Studio Teams: The Solution

## Model Overview

AI Studio Teams replaces the broken credential-to-career pipeline with a portfolio-based pathway where high school students complete authentic projects for local employers.

**Core Structure:**
- **8 teams** of 10-12 students each
- **Cross-grade composition**: 9th-12th graders on each team
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** with teacher mentor facilitation
- **Real client projects** sourced from local employers
- **Quarterly portfolio reviews** by employer panels

## The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Portfolio Over Credentials

Students build portfolios demonstrating actual capability through documented work.

| Component | Description | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Project Archive** | Completed deliverables | Client sign-off |
| **Process Documentation** | Problem-solving approach, AI utilization | Teacher assessment |
| **Skill Demonstrations** | Capability evidence mapped to employer needs | Employer panel scoring |

**Portfolio Quality Standards:** Minimum 7.0/10 rating from employer review panels. Final portfolio earns "El Segundo AI-Ready Certificate."

### Pillar 2: Near-Peer Mentorship

Each team operates through structured mentorship recreating developmental relationships disappearing from workplaces.

```
12th Graders → Mentor → 10th Graders
11th Graders → Mentor → 9th Graders
```

**Why This Works:** Two-grade separation provides enough experience differential for effective mentorship without intimidation. As seniors graduate, juniors step into mentor roles, maintaining institutional knowledge.

### Pillar 3: Employer Integration

Local employers are active partners who shape project scope, validate quality, and provide pathway opportunities.

| Employer Provides | Value to Students |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Real project briefs (quarterly) | Authentic work experience |
| Portfolio review panels (quarterly) | Direct employer feedback |
| Guest mentorship (monthly) | Industry insight |
| Micro-internship slots (ongoing) | 10-20 hour paid experiences |

**El Segundo Advantage:** Compact geography concentrates major employers—Boeing, Northrop Grumman, tech headquarters, entertainment companies—within walking distance of the high school.

## AI Integration

AI tools are embedded throughout, ensuring students develop capability to work alongside AI systems.

| Function | AI Application | Skill Developed |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Research | AI-enhanced information gathering | Critical evaluation of AI output |
| Content creation | AI drafting with human refinement | Editorial judgment |
| Documentation | AI-assisted generation | Process transparency |

## Weekly Session Structure

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-10 min | Team standup |
| 10-30 min | Mentorship pairs |
| 30-70 min | Project work |
| 70-85 min | Documentation |
| 85-90 min | Planning |
