# AI Studio Teams: The Solution

## The Core Insight

<div className="highlight-box">
  <p style={{fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold', fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#1a1a1a', textAlign: 'center', margin: 0}}>
    "We're not just teaching students to use AI tools—we're teaching them HOW TO THINK about AI problems."
  </p>
</div>

Traditional approaches give students the fish (prompts, templates, tool tutorials). AI Studio Teams teaches students to fish—building the metacognitive capabilities that transfer across any AI tool or domain.

## Model Overview

AI Studio Teams replaces the broken credential-to-career pipeline with a portfolio-based pathway where high school students complete authentic projects for local employers.

**Core Structure:**
- **8 teams** of 12 students each (9th-12th grade mix).
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** with teacher mentors.
- **Real client projects** and **Quarterly portfolio reviews**.
- **Platform support** via SkafldTrailhead AI-powered environment.

### Core Principles

**1. Research Wide, Validate Narrow**
> "The best solution to your problem probably exists in a field you've never explored."

Students learn to look OUTSIDE their immediate domain before assuming they need to invent something new. This **interdisciplinary approach** mirrors the cross-pollination that drives innovation at institutions like Stanford.

**2. Decomposition Thinking**
Every complex challenge can be broken down into smaller, more manageable decisions. Students learn to decompose problems until they reach actionable yes/no questions.

## The Three Pillars

  <div className="feature-card">
    <div className="feature-icon">📂</div>
    <h3>Portfolio Over Credentials</h3>
    <p>Students build portfolios demonstrating actual capability through documented work. Minimum 7.0/10 rating required from employer panels.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <div className="feature-icon">🤝</div>
    <h3>Near-Peer Mentorship</h3>
    <p>12th Graders → 10th Graders. 11th Graders → 9th Graders. recreate developmental relationships disappearing from workplaces.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-card">
    <div className="feature-icon">🏢</div>
    <h3>Employer Integration</h3>
    <p>Real project briefs, quarterly review panels, and micro-internship slots (10-20 hour paid experiences) with aerospace and tech leaders.</p>

This program puts **educators and learners at the heart of AI design**—ensuring these tools expand access, agency, and connection rather than replacing the human relationships essential to learning and development.
