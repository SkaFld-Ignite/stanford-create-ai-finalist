# AI Studio Teams: The Solution

## Model Overview

AI Studio Teams replaces the broken credential-to-career pipeline with a portfolio-based pathway where high school students complete authentic projects for local employers, building verified evidence of their capability to work effectively in AI-augmented environments.

**Core Structure:**
- **8 teams** of 10-12 students each
- **Cross-grade composition**: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders on each team
- **Weekly 90-minute sessions** with teacher mentor facilitation
- **Real client projects** sourced from local employers
- **Quarterly portfolio reviews** by employer panels

## The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Portfolio Over Credentials

Instead of earning grades that signal course completion, students build portfolios that demonstrate actual capability through documented work.

**Portfolio Components:**

| Component | Description | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Project Archive** | Completed deliverables from client projects | Client sign-off and acceptance |
| **Process Documentation** | Evidence of problem-solving approach and AI tool utilization | Teacher mentor assessment |
| **Reflection Narrative** | Student analysis of learning, challenges, and growth | Peer and mentor feedback |
| **Skill Demonstrations** | Specific capability evidence mapped to employer needs | Employer panel scoring |

**Portfolio Quality Standards:**
- Minimum 7.0/10 rating from employer review panels
- Quarterly review cycles with structured feedback
- Continuous improvement based on employer input
- Final portfolio earns "El Segundo AI-Ready Certificate"

### Pillar 2: Near-Peer Mentorship

Each team operates through a structured mentorship model that recreates the developmental relationships disappearing from entry-level workplaces.

**Mentorship Structure:**

```
12th Graders (Seniors)     →  Mentor  →  10th Graders (Sophomores)
                               ↓
                         Team Leadership
                               ↓
11th Graders (Juniors)     →  Mentor  →  9th Graders (Freshmen)
```

**Why This Structure Works:**

1. **Appropriate Distance**: Two-grade separation provides enough experience differential for effective mentorship without intimidation
2. **Sustainability**: As seniors graduate, juniors step into senior mentor roles, maintaining institutional knowledge
3. **Leadership Development**: Seniors develop management capabilities through actual team leadership
4. **Fresher Perspectives**: Younger students bring current tool familiarity and fresh approaches

**Mentorship Responsibilities:**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Senior Mentors (12th)** | Project scoping, client communication, quality assurance, team coordination |
| **Junior Mentors (11th)** | Technical guidance, documentation standards, process facilitation |
| **Sophomore Members (10th)** | Active project contribution, skill documentation, upward communication |
| **Freshman Members (9th)** | Learning participation, fresh perspectives, foundational skill building |

### Pillar 3: Employer Integration

Local employers are not observers or occasional visitors. They are active partners who shape project scope, validate quality, and provide pathway opportunities.

**Employer Partnership Model:**

**What Employers Provide:**

| Contribution | Frequency | Value to Students |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Real project briefs | Quarterly | Authentic work experience |
| Portfolio review panels | Quarterly | Direct employer feedback |
| Guest mentorship sessions | Monthly | Industry insight and connection |
| Micro-internship slots | Ongoing | 10-20 hour paid work experiences |
| Hiring pathway consideration | Annual | Direct employment opportunities |

**What Employers Receive:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Talent pipeline visibility | Early identification of high-potential candidates |
| Reduced hiring risk | Validated portfolios demonstrate actual capability |
| Community investment | Visible commitment to local workforce development |
| Fresh perspectives | Student teams bring current AI tool familiarity |
| Low-risk project completion | Real deliverables at manageable scope |

:::info El Segundo Advantage
El Segundo's compact geography concentrates major employers within walking distance of the high school:
- **Aerospace**: Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon
- **Technology**: Multiple tech headquarters and satellite offices
- **Entertainment**: Major studio and production company offices
- **Professional Services**: Consulting, legal, and financial firms

This density makes authentic employer integration practical in ways impossible for larger, more dispersed districts.

## AI Integration Throughout

AI tools are embedded in every aspect of the AI Studio Teams model, ensuring students develop capability to work alongside AI systems rather than being replaced by them.

**AI Tool Applications by Team Function:**

| Function | AI Tool Application | Skill Developed |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Project scoping | AI-assisted requirements analysis | Human-AI collaboration |
| Research | AI-enhanced information gathering | Critical evaluation of AI output |
| Content creation | AI drafting with human refinement | Editorial judgment and quality control |
| Process documentation | AI-assisted documentation generation | Process transparency and communication |
| Portfolio curation | AI-organized project archives | Information architecture and presentation |
| Reflection writing | AI prompts for deeper analysis | Metacognitive development |

## Weekly Session Structure

Each 90-minute weekly session follows a consistent structure:

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 0-10 min | Team standup | Progress sharing, blocker identification |
| 10-30 min | Mentorship pairs | Senior/sophomore and junior/freshman focused work |
| 30-70 min | Project work | Active collaboration on client deliverables |
| 70-85 min | Documentation | Portfolio updates and process capture |
| 85-90 min | Next week planning | Task assignment and commitment |

## The El Segundo AI-Ready Certificate

Students who complete a full year in AI Studio Teams and achieve minimum portfolio quality scores earn the El Segundo AI-Ready Certificate, a credential co-designed with employer partners.

**Certificate Requirements:**
- Minimum 3 completed client projects
- Portfolio quality score of 7.0/10 or higher from employer panel
- Demonstrated AI tool proficiency across project types
- Peer mentorship participation (for 11th-12th graders)
