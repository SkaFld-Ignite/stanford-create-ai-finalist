## OPENING: THE PROBLEM (90 seconds total)

### Slide 1: Title (15 seconds) {#slide-1}

**Speaker:** [Keith]

```
"Good afternoon. I'm [Name], joined by [teammates]. We're here from AI Studio Teams
with a question that's keeping educators and employers up at night:

How do we prepare the next generation for careers when the bridge to those careers
is collapsing?"
```

### Slide 2: The Experience Paradox (45 seconds) {#slide-2}

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"The numbers tell a stark story.

[Gesture to stats]
Two out of three employers won't hire without AI skills.
78% of hiring managers predict AI will displace recent graduates.
45% reduction in tech entry-level roles.

The floor is rising while the ladder is shrinking. That is the EXPERIENCE PARADOX:
Young people can't gain experience because the entry-level positions that provide
experience are disappearing.

[Pause - this is the hook]

But here's what makes it worse: CREDENTIALS are losing value too.

A degree shows coursework completion—not workplace capability in AI-transformed
environments. So students are trapped: no entry point to gain experience, and
credentials that don't prove they can perform.

This isn't a future problem. This is happening RIGHT NOW."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Pause after "experience are disappearing" - let it land
- "Credentials are losing value" connects to our thesis (portfolio > credentials)
- "Right NOW" creates urgency

### Slide 3: Teach Them to Fish (30 seconds) {#slide-3}

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"So what's the solution?

[Pause, then with conviction]

DON'T give them the fish. Teach them to FISH.

Most AI training teaches prompts that expire in months. ChatGPT prompts from last
year are already obsolete.

We build AI RESILIENCE THROUGH REAL BUSINESS CHALLENGES—metacognitive skills that
transfer across ANY AI tool, because tools change, but the way you THINK persists.

We're not just teaching AI. We're building AI resilience—teaching students how to LEARN."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- The "teaching to fish" metaphor is universally understood
- Emphasize "how to THINK" and "how to LEARN" - this is the differentiator
- "AI resilience" is a World Bank/EdTech Hub term (Jan 2026) — carries institutional weight
- Note: "forever" was removed per team discussion; skills evolve with continuous learning

## THE SOLUTION (90 seconds total)

### Slide 4: SkaFld Trailhead (45 seconds) {#slide-4}

**Speaker:** [Charles]

**Narrative:**
```
"This is SkaFld Trailhead—our platform for verified capability.

[Point to platform components]

Three tools working together: an AI COACH for Socratic guidance. A TEACHER
DASHBOARD giving educators real-time visibility into student progress. And an
EMPLOYER PORTAL where industry validates real work.

Teachers lead weekly 90-minute sessions through a scaffolded journey. In the
FOUNDATION phase, weeks 1-4, students learn decomposition thinking and basic
AI discernment.

Then, we ramp up the difficulty.

In the APPLICATION phase, weeks 5-8, students solve INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
business simulations. They have to expand their AI toolset—adapting to new models
and techniques—to solve problems that simple prompts can't handle.

Finally, in the DEMONSTRATION phase, weeks 9-12, they prove mastery by delivering
actual projects for local employers.

The result? Portfolios that PROVE capability—not credentials that claim it."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Emphasize "increasingly difficult" - show the progression
- "Expand their toolset" - connects to adaptability
- "Simple prompts can't handle" - reinforces "Teach to Fish"

### Slide 5: From Crutch to Catalyst (30 seconds) {#slide-5}

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"This is how we move from Crutch to Catalyst.

[Reference chat demo visual]

In this pilot scenario with Boeing, the AI coach doesn't provide the answer. 
It asks the student to DECOMPOSE the problem: 'What are the key failure points 
in quality control documentation?'

The student identifies the real-world friction: handoffs between shifts and 
manual entry errors.

Then, the AI nudges them to RESEARCH WIDE—looking at how healthcare and aviation 
have solved similar handoff challenges.

This is ACTIVE learning. The AI is a catalyst for critical thinking—and it
frees TEACHERS to do what humans do best: build relationships and provide
the motivation that no AI can replicate."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- "From Crutch to Catalyst" - direct answer to summit theme
- "AI coach doesn't provide the answer" - mechanism of catalyst
- "Research wide" - core SkaFld methodology
- Quick slide - keep momentum

**Optional addition if time permits:**
> "And crucially—the AI can be wrong. Students learn to verify, not just accept. That's the difference between AI as crutch and AI as catalyst."

<a href="#slide-6" class="slide-click-link">CLICK to Slide 6 →</a>

### Slide 6: Four Pillars (30 seconds) {#slide-6}

**Speaker:** [Keith]

**Narrative:**
```
"Our approach is built on four pillars—each backed by validated learning science.
These aren't four separate courses—they're integrated into every project.

[Quick overview of four pillars]

PORTFOLIO over credentials: Work samples predict job success FIVE TIMES better
than grades. Schmidt and Hunter's meta-analysis.

SOCIAL LEARNING & MENTORSHIP: Teachers lead. Seniors mentor sophomores. AI
scaffolds the connections between them—amplifying what humans do best.

EMPLOYER integration: Real projects with real stakes. Lave and Wenger proved
authentic context produces deeper understanding.

And RESPONSIBLE AI practices—students learn WHY ethical boundaries matter.
Active judgment, not just guardrails. This is Human-Centered AI."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Say "four pillars" to establish the framework
- **"Integrated, not isolated"** — external validation from World Bank CoI (Jan 2026): skills, literacy, and ethics taught together
- Quickly cite the research—establishes credibility without dwelling
- Connect back to employer verification (thesis: portfolios prove capability)
- **Emphasize "Human-Centered AI"** - aligns with slide footer

**Verbal expansion on Responsible AI (if time/interest permits):**
> "For students, policy and strategy are complementary parts of AI training. Policy helps them understand ethical, legal, and governance boundaries. Strategy shows how AI projects align with organizational goals. Together, they see how responsible design shapes real-world AI solutions—AI that augments human potential and respects human dignity."

## THE METHODOLOGY & DIFFERENTIATION (60 seconds total)

### Slide 7: SkaFld Ideation Methodology (20 seconds) {#slide-7}

**Speaker:** [Charles]

**Narrative:**
```
"This is the methodology we teach. A three-step process to innovation.

First, ESCAPE the 'Expert Trap'—stop assuming you know the answer.

Second, RESEARCH WIDE. We guide students to explore INVERSE, ANALOGOUS, and
EXTREME domains.

Third, VALIDATE NARROW. Translate those patterns back to the problem and prove
they work.

That's how students generate breakthroughs on demand."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Walk through the visual steps: Escape -> Research -> Validate
- Emphasize the "Research Wide" phase as the core differentiator
- "Breakthroughs on demand" creates a sense of repeatable capability

### Slide 8: El Segundo Pilot (30 seconds) {#slide-8}

**Speaker:** [Charles]

**Narrative:**
```
"Why El Segundo?

The nation's densest aerospace and tech corridor. Boeing. Northrop Grumman.
Entertainment headquarters. 5 schools. 3,400 students. We're already
co-designing with district teachers—built WITH educators, not imposed on them.

Year 1: 96 students in 8 teams. 12 employer partners. 24 paid internships.

This is proof of concept for California-wide expansion in Year 2, and national
SaaS rollout in Year 3.

Stanford CREATE+AI is the catalyst that makes all of this possible."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Quick stats to establish scale and credibility
- Employer names add legitimacy (aerospace industry)
- Clear path from pilot to scale

## EQUITY & TEAM (60 seconds total)

### Slide 9: Equity - Universal Design (30 seconds) {#slide-9}

**Speaker:** [Keith]

**Narrative:**
```
"We're moving beyond simple access to UNIVERSAL LEARNING.

Whose voice does the AI represent? Who benefits from the tool's design?
Who has the power to shape these systems?

Our answer: EVERYONE.

[Point to targets]
50% female representation target.
40% free and reduced lunch eligible.
30% first-generation college.

We apply UNIVERSAL DESIGN principles.

No coding prerequisites. No GPA hurdles. No equipment costs.

Portfolios are the great equalizer. They shift the focus from where you went to
school to what you can DO. Focus on what you can do. Unlock your potential."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- "Universal Learning" - aligns with summit themes
- Concrete parity targets demonstrate commitment
- "Portfolios are the great equalizer" - connects equity to thesis

<a href="#slide-10" class="slide-click-link">CLICK to Slide 10 →</a>

---

### Slide 10: The Team (30 seconds) {#slide-10}

**Speaker:** [Charles]

**Narrative:**
```
"We're the right team to execute this.

[Charles] Charles Sims—Project Director. Former CTO of the LA Clippers and United
Talent Agency. Founder of SkaFld Studio. Board Member of the El Segundo Economic
Development Committee—direct ties to our pilot community.

[Keith] Keith Coleman—Strategy and Partnerships. Advisory Scholar at Stanford
mediaX. Co-Chair of the UN SDG Fund Breakthrough Alliance. Delegate Assembly,
CA School Boards Association.

[Mike] Mike Belloli—Technology and Operations. COO of SkaFld Studio. Co-Founder of
Lyfe AI and Defy Mortgage. A full-stack developer and platform architect
expert in scaling operations and data security.

Technology. Design. Policy. We bring interdisciplinary expertise to match our
interdisciplinary methodology."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Stanford connection with Keith establishes insider credibility
- Each person has distinct domain expertise
- "Technology. Design. Policy." - the new header (replaced "Stanford DNA")

## CLOSE (60 seconds total)

### Slide 11: The Ask (30 seconds) {#slide-11}

**Speaker:** [Charles]

:::tip Choose Your Variant Based on Room Energy
Read the judges during Q&A and other presentations. If they seem receptive to bold vision, use **Variant A**. If they seem focused on feasibility and what $50K actually buys, use **Variant B**. Both work with the same slide.
:::

#### VARIANT A: Ambitious (Growth Vision)

**Use when:** Judges seem excited about scale, ask about national impact, investors in the room are engaged.

```
"The first dollar is the hardest. This is that dollar.

[Gesture to funding bar]
$50,000 funds Year 1: platform development, pilot implementation, assessment,
and operations.

This award proves the model. It enables conversations with district partners,
industry sponsors, and impact investors that turn a pilot into a movement.

Scaling nationally will require significant additional investment—and this
is the proof-of-concept that makes that investment possible. Stanford's
backing opens every door we need.

Year 2 and beyond is sustainable: District CTE contracts and employer
partners fund ongoing operations."
```

#### VARIANT B: Conservative (MVP Pilot)

**Use when:** Judges seem focused on feasibility, ask about what $50K actually delivers, or if other teams are making modest asks.

```
"The first dollar is the hardest. This is that dollar.

[Gesture to funding bar]
$50,000 gets us to a working MVP pilot in El Segundo. 96 students. 12
employer partners. 24 internships. Validated portfolios.

That's what this funding delivers—a proven model with real outcomes.

Building the scalable platform for Year 2 and beyond will need additional
investment, but we'll have the evidence to earn it. District CTE contracts
and employer partners are already designed into the sustainability model.

This $50K proves it works. Everything else follows from that proof."
```

**Key Emphasis (both variants):**
- "First dollar is hardest" - creates emotional resonance
- Frame $50K as CATALYST, not the full solution
- Stanford backing unlocks larger funding conversations
- Demonstrate clear sustainability path
- **Do NOT name a specific total** beyond $50K — keep it open-ended

### Slide 12: Closing (30 seconds) {#slide-12}

**Speaker:** [Lead closes - strong finish]

**Narrative:**
```
"AI Studio Teams.

Teaching the next generation to fish.

The entry-level bridge is collapsing. Credentials are losing their value. And
young people need a new pathway to careers.

We're rebuilding that bridge—through portfolios that prove capability,
mentorship that develops potential, and AI that teaches HOW to learn.

This isn't another supplement to existing pathways. It's a transformation of
how students prove what they can do.

Human-centered. Interdisciplinary. Portfolio-proven.

Thank you. We're ready for your questions."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Circle back to opening ("bridge collapsing")
- "Transformation, not supplement" - signals systemic change, not incremental
- Triple tagline: "Human-centered. Interdisciplinary. Portfolio-proven."
- Confident close

## Q&A PREPARATION (4 minutes)

### Likely Questions and Responses

**1. "How is this different from existing CTE or career prep programs?"**

> "Three key differences. First, we're portfolio-based, not credential-based. Students
> graduate with employer-validated work samples, not just transcripts. Second, we teach
> HOW to learn, not just AI tools—metacognitive skills that transfer across any
> technology. Third, we integrate REAL employers from day one. These aren't simulations.
> Students work on actual business challenges and receive actual feedback from the
> professionals they'll work alongside."

**2. "How do you address AI ethics and safety concerns?"**

> "Beyond guardrails. Yes, our platform has content moderation and safety filters. But
> more importantly, we actively TEACH policy and strategy awareness. Policy helps students
> understand ethical, legal, and governance boundaries. Strategy shows how AI projects
> align with organizational goals. Together, they see how responsible design and strategic
> thinking shape effective, real-world AI solutions.
>
> We extend traditional user-centered design to consider broader social impacts—building
> ethical AI that augments human potential and respects human dignity. Students develop
> judgment for when human oversight must override AI suggestions. This is human-centered
> design—not just protecting students from AI, but empowering them to shape responsible AI use."

**3. "What makes the team qualified?"**

> "Interdisciplinary expertise that matches our methodology. Keith brings Stanford
> connections through mediaX and deep policy experience with the UN SDG Fund. Charles
> has led technology transformation at the LA Clippers and UTA—he knows how to deliver
> high-impact projects under pressure. Mike provides the technical foundation with
> platform development and compliance expertise. Together, we have the relationships,
> the methodology, and the execution capability."

**4. "How will you ensure equity outcomes?"**

> "Design, not hope. Zero barriers to entry—no prerequisites, no equipment costs.
> Explicit parity targets that we track and report. And most importantly, portfolio-
> based assessment, which research shows reduces demographic bias compared to
> credential-based evaluation. We're not hoping diversity happens; we're designing
> systems where it's built in."

**5. "What happens if the pilot doesn't meet targets?"**

> "We have clear metrics and feedback loops. Quarterly portfolio reviews with employer
> panels provide early signals. If outcomes lag, we adjust. The beauty of our model is
> it's built on learning science that works—we're applying proven methodologies to a
> new context. But we're humble enough to iterate based on data."

**6. "Why El Segundo specifically?"**

> "Concentration and access. It's the nation's densest aerospace and tech corridor—
> Boeing, Northrop Grumman, entertainment headquarters—all within walking distance of
> schools. 3,400 students across 5 schools means tight-knit community. The district is
> actively seeking workforce development solutions. And success here creates a
> replicable model for other concentrated industry corridors nationwide."

**7. "How is this sustainable beyond Stanford funding?"**

> "Three revenue streams for Year 2 and beyond. First, CTE pathway integration—schools
> already allocate budgets for career-technical education, and we're a better use of
> those dollars. Second, employer contributions—companies invest in pipeline programs
> that deliver job-ready candidates. Third, platform licensing as we expand.
> The $50,000 proves the model works. Sustainability comes from demonstrated outcomes
> that districts and employers are willing to fund."
