# AI Studio Teams: 6-Minute Refined Pitch Narrative

**Stanford CREATE+AI Finals | Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities**
**Pitch Date:** February 10, 2026
**Format:** 6 minutes presentation + 4 minutes Q&A

---

## OPENING: THE PROBLEM (90 seconds total)

### Slide 1: Title (15 seconds)
**Speaker: Keith**
"Good afternoon. I'm Keith Coleman, joined by Charles Sims and Mike Belloli. 
We're here from AI Studio Teams with a question that's keeping educators and 
employers up at night: How do we prepare the next generation for careers when 
the bridge to those careers—the entry-level role—is collapsing? Let's look at 
the numbers behind this failure."

### Slide 2: The Experience Paradox (45 seconds)
**Speaker: Keith**
"The numbers tell a stark story. Two out of three employers won't hire without 
AI skills. 78% of managers predict AI will displace fresh graduates. 

This is the EXPERIENCE PARADOX: Young people can't gain experience because the 
entry points are disappearing.

But it's worse: CREDENTIALS are losing their signal value. A degree proves 
coursework, not workplace agency in an AI-transformed world. This isn't a 
future problem. It's happening RIGHT NOW. So how do we move from crisis to 
capability?"

### Slide 3: Teach Them to Fish (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Keith**
"The central question of this era is: Will AI be a crutch or a catalyst? 
We answer with an **Agency-First Paradigm**.

DON'T give them the fish. Teach them to FISH.

Stanford research on the Human Agency Scale shows the workforce favors an 
'Equal Partnership'—or H3 mode. We build that **Agency** through real 
business challenges—metacognitive skills that transfer across any tool, 
because tools change, but the way you THINK persists. To show you how we 
deliver this thinking at scale, I'll hand it over to Charles to introduce 
the platform."

## THE SOLUTION (150 seconds total)

### Slide 4: SkaFld Trailhead - Student Outcomes (45 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"This is SkaFld Trailhead—our platform for verified capability. We focus on 
empowering student agency through personalized AI coaching.

Adaptive learning paths dynamically adjust complexity for each learner. 
Students receive real-time Socratic feedback that forces decomposition 
thinking. We identify skill gaps and strengths mapped to industry demand, 
tracking growth and mastery rather than just deficiencies. 

The result? Verified evidence that proves capability to employers."

### Slide 5: Leverage Teacher Expertise (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"But the platform doesn't just empower students—it leverages the expert domain 
knowledge of our teachers. 

Educators move from content deliverers to expert mentors—guiding strategic 
framing, leading cross-domain synthesis, and providing the professional 
validation AI can't replicate.

We see 90% engagement in expert-led sessions and a 40% boost in mastery when 
students apply domain knowledge to real challenges."

### Slide 6: Bridge the Talent Gap - Employer ROI (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"Finally, we solve the crisis for employers. SkaFld provides verified 
human-AI synergy—letting you see exactly how students collaborate with AI 
before you hire them.

We move to a portfolio-first recruiting model, reducing entry-level hiring 
risk by 60%. Students graduate with reduced time-to-productivity, 
ready to contribute from Day 1.

This isn't just education—it's a high-fidelity talent pipeline. Now, let's 
see this expert-led enablement in action."

### Slide 7: From Crutch to Catalyst (45 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"This is how we move from Crutch to Catalyst. In this pilot scenario with 
Boeing, the AI coach doesn't provide the answer. It forces **Decomposition 
Thinking**: 'What are the key failure points in documentation?'

The student identifies the real-world friction: handoffs and manual errors. 
Then, the AI nudges them to RESEARCH WIDE.

This is ACTIVE learning. The AI is a catalyst for critical thinking—freeing 
TEACHERS to do what humans do best: build relationships and provide 
motivation. Keith, take us through the science that powers this model."

## THE METHODOLOGY & DIFFERENTIATION (60 seconds total)

### Slide 8: Four Pillars (20 seconds)
**Speaker: Keith**
"Our model addresses the shifting skill demands identified by Stanford HAI—
moving from data management to **Social Learning**. Our four pillars are 
integrated into every project.

**Portfolio over Credentials** because work samples predict success 5x better. 
**Peer-Mentorship** to develop interpersonal coordination. **Employer 
Integration** for authentic stakes.

And **Responsible AI**—teaching students WHY ethical boundaries matter 
through active judgment."

### Slide 9: SkaFld Ideation Methodology (20 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"Our methodology develops **Epistemic Fluency**—the capacity to evaluate 
knowledge in an AI landscape.

First, **ESCAPE** the Expert Trap. Second, **RESEARCH WIDE** across 
analogous domains. Third, **VALIDATE NARROW**.

We train students to be 'critics' of AI outputs, detecting hallucinations 
and generating breakthroughs on demand. We're proving this right now in 
the nation's densest tech corridor."

### Slide 10: El Segundo Pilot (20 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"We are testing this in El Segundo—the nation's densest tech corridor. We're 
already co-designing with district teachers—built WITH educators, not 
imposed on them.

This pilot is a rigorous exercise in **Implementation Science**, providing a 
scalable template for validating educational effectiveness.

Stanford CREATE+AI is the catalyst that turns this pilot into a movement. 
Keith, how are we designing for equity?"

## EQUITY & TEAM (60 seconds total)

### Slide 11: Equity - Universal Design (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Keith**
"We're moving beyond Access Equity to achieve **Agency Equity**—the power to 
not just use AI, but to critically evaluate, shape, and critique the systems 
themselves.

We apply **Universal Design** principles. 50% female. 40% low-income. 
30% first-gen. Portfolios are the great equalizer, shifting the focus from 
pedigree to proven capability. Charles?"

### Slide 12: The Team (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"We're the right team to execute this.

**Charles Sims**—Project Director, former CTO at LA Clippers/UTA. 
**Keith Coleman**—Strategy, Stanford mediaX Advisory Scholar. 
**Mike Belloli**—Technology, architect expert in data security.

Technology. Design. Policy. We have the team and the methodology—now we 
need the catalyst to ignite the first phase."

## CLOSE (60 seconds total)

### Slide 13: The Ask (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"The first dollar is the hardest. This is that dollar.

$50,000 funds our Year 1 infrastructure and validates the model through 
implementation science. This award enables the larger conversations with 
district and industry partners that turn proof-of-concept into a movement.

Stanford's backing opens every door we need. Year 2+ is sustainable 
through district contracts."

### Slide 14: Closing (30 seconds)
**Speaker: Charles**
"AI Studio Teams. Teaching the next generation to fish.

We're rebuilding the career bridge—through portfolios that prove capability, 
mentorship that develops potential, and AI that builds **Agency**.

Human-centered. Interdisciplinary. Portfolio-proven. Thank you."
