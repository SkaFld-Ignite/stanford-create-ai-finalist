## OPENING: THE PROBLEM (90 seconds total)

### Slide 1: Title (15 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Charles or Keith opens]

```
"Good afternoon. I'm [Name], joined by [teammates]. We're here from AI Studio Teams
with a question that's keeping educators and employers up at night:

How do we prepare the next generation for careers when the bridge to those careers
is collapsing?"
```

### Slide 2: The Experience Paradox (45 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"The numbers tell a stark story.

[Gesture to stats]
40% of employers plan AI workforce reductions.
45% reduction in tech entry-level roles.
78% of hiring managers predict AI will displace recent graduates.

This is the EXPERIENCE PARADOX: Young people can't gain experience because the
entry-level positions that provide experience are disappearing.

[Pause - this is the hook]

But here's what makes it worse: CREDENTIALS are losing value too.

A degree shows coursework completion—not workplace capability in AI-transformed
environments. So students are trapped: no entry point to gain experience, and
credentials that don't prove they can perform.

This isn't a future problem. This is happening RIGHT NOW."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Pause after "experience are disappearing" - let it land
- "Credentials are losing value" connects to our thesis (portfolio > credentials)
- "Right NOW" creates urgency

**[CLICK to Slide 3]**

### Slide 3: Teach Them to Fish (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"So what's the solution?

[Pause, then with conviction]

DON'T give them the fish. Teach them to FISH.

Most AI training teaches prompts that expire in months. ChatGPT prompts from last
year are already obsolete.

We teach METACOGNITIVE SKILLS THROUGH REAL BUSINESS CHALLENGES—skills that
transfer across ANY AI tool, because tools change, but the way you THINK persists.

We're not just teaching AI. We're teaching students how to LEARN."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- The "teaching to fish" metaphor is universally understood
- Emphasize "how to THINK" and "how to LEARN" - this is the differentiator
- Note: "forever" was removed per team discussion; skills evolve with continuous learning

**[CLICK to Slide 4]**

## THE SOLUTION (90 seconds total)

### Slide 4: SkaFld Trailhead (45 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Can transition to Mike or Charles here]

**Narrative:**
```
"This is SkaFld Trailhead—our platform for verified capability.

[Point to three layers, bottom to top]

It's a scaffolded journey. In the FOUNDATION phase, weeks 1-4, students learn
decomposition thinking and basic AI discernment.

Then, we ramp up the difficulty.

In the APPLICATION phase, weeks 5-8, students solve INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
business simulations. They have to expand their AI toolset—adapting to new models
and techniques—to solve problems that simple prompts can't handle.

Finally, in the DEMONSTRATION phase, weeks 9-12, they prove mastery by delivering
actual projects for local employers.

The result? Portfolios that PROVE capability—not credentials that claim it."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Emphasize "increasingly difficult" - show the progression
- "Expand their toolset" - connects to adaptability
- "Simple prompts can't handle" - reinforces "Teach to Fish"

**[CLICK to Slide 5]**

### Slide 5: AI as Coach Demo (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Continue or visual only]

**Narrative:**
```
"Here's how our Socratic AI coach works in practice.

[Reference chat demo visual]

Notice the AI doesn't provide the answer. It asks: 'What OTHER fields have already
solved a similar problem?'

The student responds by looking outside their immediate domain—game designers for
engagement, aviation for error reduction.

The AI encourages: 'Now we're thinking! Decompose it into testable pieces.'

This is ACTIVE learning. The AI is a coach, not a crutch."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- "Coach, not a crutch" - memorable phrase
- Demonstrates practical implementation of "teach to fish"
- Quick slide - keep momentum

**[CLICK to Slide 6]**

---

### Slide 6: Four Pillars (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"Our approach is built on four pillars—each backed by validated learning science.
Building capability that employers can actually verify.

[Quick overview of four pillars]

PORTFOLIO over credentials: Work samples predict job success FIVE TIMES better
than grades. Schmidt and Hunter's meta-analysis.

NEAR-PEER mentorship: Seniors mentor sophomores. Teaching reinforces learning.

EMPLOYER integration: Real projects with real stakes. Lave and Wenger proved
authentic context produces deeper understanding.

And RESPONSIBLE AI practices—students learn WHY ethical boundaries matter.
Active judgment, not just guardrails."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Say "four pillars" to establish the framework
- Quickly cite the research—establishes credibility without dwelling
- Connect back to employer verification (thesis: portfolios prove capability)

**[CLICK to Slide 7]**

---

## THE METHODOLOGY & DIFFERENTIATION (60 seconds total)

### Slide 7: SkaFld Ideation Methodology (20 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Keith or Charles - methodology ownership]

**Narrative:**
```
"This is the methodology we teach. A three-step process to innovation.

First, ESCAPE the 'Expert Trap'—stop assuming you know the answer.

Second, RESEARCH WIDE. We guide students to explore INVERSE, ANALOGOUS, and
EXTREME domains.

Third, VALIDATE NARROW. Translate those patterns back to the problem and prove
they work.

That's how students generate breakthroughs on demand."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Walk through the visual steps: Escape -> Research -> Validate
- Emphasize the "Research Wide" phase as the core differentiator
- "Breakthroughs on demand" creates a sense of repeatable capability

**[CLICK to Slide 8]**

---

### Slide 8: El Segundo Pilot (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Continue]

**Narrative:**
```
"Why El Segundo?

The nation's densest aerospace and tech corridor. Boeing. Northrop Grumman.
Entertainment headquarters. 5 schools. 3,400 students.

Year 1: 96 students in 8 teams. 12 employer partners. 24 paid internships.

This is proof of concept for California-wide expansion in Year 2, and national
SaaS rollout in Year 3.

The $50,000 from Stanford CREATE+AI is the leverage that makes all of this possible."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Quick stats to establish scale and credibility
- Employer names add legitimacy (aerospace industry)
- Clear path from pilot to scale

**[CLICK to Slide 9]**

---

## EQUITY & TEAM (60 seconds total)

### Slide 9: Equity - Access for All (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Can transition speakers here]

**Narrative:**
```
"Who gets access to these opportunities?

Our answer: EVERYONE.

[Point to targets]
50% female representation target.
40% free and reduced lunch eligible.
30% first-generation college.

And we mean ZERO BARRIERS.

No coding prerequisites. No GPA hurdles. No equipment costs.

Portfolios are the great equalizer. They shift the focus from where you went to
school to what you can DO. Focus on what you can do. Unlock your potential."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- "Access for ALL" - positive framing (removed "privilege" language per team discussion)
- Concrete parity targets demonstrate commitment
- "Portfolios are the great equalizer" - connects equity to thesis

**[CLICK to Slide 10]**

---

### Slide 10: The Team (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Each person can intro briefly, or one person covers all]

**Narrative:**
```
"We're the right team to execute this.

[Charles] Charles Sims—Project Director. Former CTO of the LA Clippers and United
Talent Agency. Creator of the SkaFld Ideation Methodology.

[Keith] Keith Coleman—Stanford Liaison. Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Stanford
mediaX. Co-Chair of the UN SDG Fund Breakthrough Alliance.

[Mike] Mike Belloli—Technology Lead. COO of SkaFld Studio. Co-Founder of
Lyfe AI and Defy Mortgage. A full-stack developer and platform architect
expert in scaling operations and data security.

Technology. Design. Policy. We bring interdisciplinary expertise to match our
interdisciplinary methodology."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Stanford connection with Keith establishes insider credibility
- Each person has distinct domain expertise
- "Technology. Design. Policy." - the new header (replaced "Stanford DNA")

**[CLICK to Slide 11]**

## CLOSE (60 seconds total)

### Slide 11: The Ask (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Lead closes]

**Narrative:**
```
"The first dollar is the hardest. This is that dollar.

To do this right—to build a scalable national platform—takes $500K to a million.
Stanford CREATE+AI is the LEVERAGE that unlocks the rest.

[Gesture to funding bar]
$50,000 funds Year 1: platform development, pilot implementation, assessment,
and operations. $521 per student.

This award proves the model. It enables conversations with district partners,
industry sponsors, and impact investors that turn a pilot into a movement.

Year 2 and beyond is sustainable: Recurring District Contracts and Employer
partners cover the program cost. This $50K is the seed that proves it works."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- "First dollar is hardest" - creates emotional resonance
- Frame $50K as LEVERAGE, not the full solution (per team discussion)
- Stanford backing unlocks larger funding conversations
- Demonstrate clear sustainability path

**[CLICK to Slide 12]**

---

### Slide 12: Closing (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** [Lead closes - strong finish]

**Narrative:**
```
"AI Studio Teams.

Teaching the next generation to fish.

The entry-level bridge is collapsing. Credentials are losing their value. And
young people need a new pathway to careers.

We're rebuilding that bridge—through portfolios that prove capability,
mentorship that develops potential, and AI that teaches HOW to learn.

Human-centered. Interdisciplinary. Portfolio-proven.

Thank you. We're ready for your questions."
```

**Key Emphasis:**
- Circle back to opening ("bridge collapsing")
- Triple tagline: "Human-centered. Interdisciplinary. Portfolio-proven."
- Confident close

## Q&A PREPARATION (4 minutes)

### Likely Questions and Responses

**1. "How is this different from existing CTE or career prep programs?"**

> "Three key differences. First, we're portfolio-based, not credential-based. Students
> graduate with employer-validated work samples, not just transcripts. Second, we teach
> HOW to learn, not just AI tools—metacognitive skills that transfer across any
> technology. Third, we integrate REAL employers from day one. These aren't simulations.
> Students work on actual business challenges and receive actual feedback from the
> professionals they'll work alongside."

**2. "How do you address AI ethics and safety concerns?"**

> "Beyond guardrails. Yes, our platform has content moderation and safety filters. But
> more importantly, we actively TEACH policy and strategy awareness. Students learn WHY
> ethical boundaries matter. They develop judgment for when human oversight should
> override AI suggestions. This is human-centered design—not just protecting students
> from AI, but empowering them to shape responsible AI use."

**3. "What makes the team qualified?"**

> "Interdisciplinary expertise that matches our methodology. Keith brings Stanford
> connections through mediaX and deep policy experience with the UN SDG Fund. Charles
> has led technology transformation at the LA Clippers and UTA—he knows how to deliver
> high-impact projects under pressure. Mike provides the technical foundation with
> platform development and compliance expertise. Together, we have the relationships,
> the methodology, and the execution capability."

**4. "How will you ensure equity outcomes?"**

> "Design, not hope. Zero barriers to entry—no prerequisites, no equipment costs.
> Explicit parity targets that we track and report. And most importantly, portfolio-
> based assessment, which research shows reduces demographic bias compared to
> credential-based evaluation. We're not hoping diversity happens; we're designing
> systems where it's built in."

**5. "What happens if the pilot doesn't meet targets?"**

> "We have clear metrics and feedback loops. Quarterly portfolio reviews with employer
> panels provide early signals. If outcomes lag, we adjust. The beauty of our model is
> it's built on learning science that works—we're applying proven methodologies to a
> new context. But we're humble enough to iterate based on data."

**6. "Why El Segundo specifically?"**

> "Concentration and access. It's the nation's densest aerospace and tech corridor—
> Boeing, Northrop Grumman, entertainment headquarters—all within walking distance of
> schools. 3,400 students across 5 schools means tight-knit community. The district is
> actively seeking workforce development solutions. And success here creates a
> replicable model for other concentrated industry corridors nationwide."

**7. "How is this sustainable beyond Stanford funding?"**

> "Three revenue streams for Year 2 and beyond. First, CTE pathway integration—schools
> pay for career-technical education. Second, employer contributions—companies
> sponsor teams and internship pipelines. Third, platform licensing—our SaaS model
> lets other districts adopt the system. The $50,000 is seed capital that proves the
> model; sustainability comes from demonstrated outcomes."
