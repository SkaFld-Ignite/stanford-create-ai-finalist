# Learning Science Foundation

AI Studio Teams draws on established learning science research across three domains.

## Portfolio-Based Assessment

Portfolio assessment has a robust evidence base demonstrating advantages over traditional credentialing.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Portfolios predict job performance better than GPA | Resnick & Resnick, 1992 | Employer validation ensures relevance |
| Portfolio development increases metacognitive awareness | Paulson & Paulson, 1991 | Reflection builds self-assessment |
| Portfolio-based hiring reduces demographic bias | Rivera, 2015 | Work samples enable capability-based evaluation |

**Why Portfolios Outperform Credentials:** Traditional credentials measure knowledge at graduation. Portfolios demonstrate continuous capability through documented work—including AI tool proficiency.

## Near-Peer Mentorship

Near-peer mentorship produces learning gains that expert instruction alone cannot achieve.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Near-peer mentors are more approachable | Lockspeiser et al., 2008 | Two-grade separation optimizes accessibility |
| Teaching reinforces mentor's learning | Topping, 2005 | Seniors deepen understanding through mentoring |
| Peer learning develops professional identity | Boud et al., 1999 | Students see themselves as capable professionals |

**The Two-Grade Separation Principle:** Optimal peer learning occurs when the experience gap provides credibility without intimidation. One grade is too close; three or more creates social distance barriers.

## Authentic Learning Theory

Learning in authentic contexts with genuine stakes produces deeper understanding and better transfer.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Situated learning produces better skill transfer | Lave & Wenger, 1991 | Real projects enable future application |
| Authentic tasks increase cognitive engagement | Brown et al., 1989 | Client deadlines create genuine motivation |
| Community of practice participation develops expertise | Wenger, 1998 | Team structure creates professional community |

**Why Simulation Falls Short:** Traditional CTE simulates workplaces but cannot replicate real stakes, real audiences, and real quality standards.

## AI Collaboration Principles

Students learn to direct AI systems, evaluate output quality, and add human judgment—developing the collaboration skills employers increasingly require.
