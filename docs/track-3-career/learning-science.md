# Learning Science Foundation

AI Studio Teams draws on established learning science research across three domains.

## Portfolio-Based Assessment

Portfolio assessment has a robust evidence base demonstrating advantages over traditional credentialing.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Work samples predict job performance far better than credentials | Schmidt & Hunter, 1998 | Employer validation ensures relevance |
| Portfolio development increases metacognitive awareness | Paulson & Paulson, 1991 | Reflection builds self-assessment |
| Blind evaluation of work samples reduces demographic bias | Goldin & Rouse, 2000; Bohnet, 2016 | Capability-based evaluation promotes equity |

**Why Portfolios Outperform Credentials:** Schmidt and Hunter's landmark meta-analysis of 85 years of research found that work samples (r=.54) predict job performance far better than education credentials (r=.10). By building portfolios of employer-validated work, students create evidence of capability that transcends traditional credentialing limitations.

## Near-Peer Mentorship

Near-peer mentorship produces learning gains that expert instruction alone cannot achieve.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Near-peer mentors are more approachable | Lockspeiser et al., 2008 | Two-grade separation optimizes accessibility |
| Teaching reinforces mentor's learning | Topping, 2005 | Seniors deepen understanding through mentoring |
| Peer learning develops professional identity | Boud et al., 1999 | Students see themselves as capable professionals |

**The Two-Grade Separation Principle:** Optimal peer learning occurs when the experience gap provides credibility without intimidation. One grade is too close; three or more creates social distance barriers.

## Authentic Learning Theory

Learning in authentic contexts with genuine stakes produces deeper understanding and better transfer.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Situated learning produces better skill transfer | Lave & Wenger, 1991 | Real projects enable future application |
| Authentic tasks increase cognitive engagement | Brown et al., 1989 | Client deadlines create genuine motivation |
| Community of practice participation develops expertise | Wenger, 1998 | Team structure creates professional community |

**Why Simulation Falls Short:** Traditional CTE simulates workplaces but cannot replicate real stakes, real audiences, and real quality standards.

## Human-Centered AI Principles

Students learn to direct AI systems, evaluate output quality, and add human judgment—developing the collaboration skills employers increasingly require.

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| AI literacy requires critical evaluation skills | Long & Magerko, 2020 | Students must verify AI outputs, not accept blindly |
| Effective AI use requires epistemic fluency | Markauskaite & Goodyear, 2017 | **True AI Literacy** requires evaluating the nature of knowledge itself |
| Ethical AI interaction improves long-term outcomes | UNESCO, 2021 | Early guardrails prevent problematic habits |

**Teaching AI Discernment:** Students develop the ability to recognize AI hallucinations—plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs—through systematic verification practices. This critical skill prevents the common trap of over-trusting AI-generated content.

**Ethical Use From the Start:** By embedding appropriate use boundaries into every project, students internalize responsible AI practices before entering the workforce. This includes transparency about AI contributions and understanding when human judgment must override AI suggestions.

**Policy and Strategy as Complementary Training:** For students, policy and strategy provide essential context for technical AI work. Policy helps students understand the ethical, legal, and governance boundaries involved in developing AI, while strategy demonstrates how AI projects align with organizational goals. Together, they enable students to see how responsible design and strategic thinking shape effective, real-world AI solutions. This approach extends traditional user-centered design by considering broader social impacts—building ethical and trustworthy AI that augments human potential and respects human dignity.
