# SkaFld Studio x Strategic Alignment: Portfolio-Based Pathways

**Stanford CREATE AI Challenge | Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities**

**Funding Request:** $50,000
**Implementation Partner:** El Segundo Unified School District
**Project Duration:** 12 months

---

## Executive Summary

The pathway from education to employment is breaking. As AI transforms the workforce, entry-level positions are disappearing at an alarming rate—creating an **"experience paradox"** where young people cannot gain experience because employers no longer offer the entry points that traditionally provided it. This isn't a future problem—this is the landscape TODAY's students will enter within 24-48 months.

**SkaFld Studio x Strategic Alignment** addresses this crisis by
**rebuilding the bridge to careers**—a structured approach to nurturing human
potential through verified capability. Our model replaces the broken
credential-to-career pipeline with a portfolio-based pathway where cross-grade
teams of 8-12 high school students complete authentic projects for local
employers, building verified portfolios that prove their ability to work
effectively alongside AI systems.

### Don't Give Them the Fish. Teach Them to Fish.

Most AI education gives students prompts that expire in months. **We teach metacognitive skills through real business challenges**—skills that transfer across any AI tool, because tools change, but the way you THINK persists. Through the SkaFld Ideation Methodology, students learn not just how to use AI tools, but how to THINK about problems—combining decomposition thinking, cross-domain pattern recognition, and responsible AI practices.

This program puts **educators and learners at the heart of Human-Centered AI design**—leveraging **"Social Learning"** to ensure these tools expand access, agency, and connection rather than replacing the human relationships essential to learning. We answer the "AI Inflection Point" by focusing on the **Why** of learning—agency, connection, and flourishing. Like Stanford's commitment to interdisciplinary learning, we combine technical capability with policy awareness and strategic thinking for responsible AI deployment.

### The Innovation

Unlike traditional career preparation that relies on classroom simulation, AI Studio Teams operates at the intersection of four transformative approaches:

1. **Portfolio Over Credentials**: Students graduate with employer-validated work samples, not just transcripts
2. **Social Learning & Mentorship**: 12th graders mentor 10th graders; 11th graders mentor 9th graders, using AI to deepen human connection rather than replace it
3. **Employer Integration**: Local companies provide real projects, quarterly portfolio reviews, and micro-internship pathways
4. **Responsible AI Foundation**: Students learn ethical AI interaction—including hallucination detection and appropriate use boundaries—preparing them to work alongside AI systems with discernment

### Why El Segundo

El Segundo represents an ideal implementation environment: a compact district (5 schools, 3,400 students) with direct access to major employers including aerospace leaders (Boeing, Northrop Grumman), technology companies, and entertainment industry headquarters. This concentration enables authentic employer partnerships and **interdisciplinary practice** that would be impossible in larger, more dispersed districts.

### Expected Outcomes (12 months)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Students with employer-validated portfolios | 96 students (8 teams of 12) |
| Employer partners providing real projects | 12 companies |
| Micro-internship placements | 24 students (25%) |
| Portfolio quality score (employer-rated) | 7.0/10 minimum |
| Gender parity in participation | 50/50 target |

:::info Stanford Alignment
This proposal directly addresses CREATE AI's Track 3 focus on "AI solutions that support skill-building, mentorship, and pathways to meaningful work." SkaFld Studio x Strategic Alignment transforms how students develop career-ready capabilities by embedding AI collaboration into authentic project work validated by actual employers.
