| **Communication** | 15% | Clarity, audience awareness, documentation |
| **Collaboration Evidence** | 15% | Team contribution, mentorship, feedback integration |

**Scoring**: Each dimension rated 1-10, weighted average produces final score. Minimum 7.0 required for AI-Ready Certificate.

### Student Skill Self-Assessment

Students complete quarterly self-assessments mapping their development across key competencies:

| Competency Domain | Skills Assessed |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Technical** | AI tool proficiency, domain-specific skills, documentation |
| **Professional** | Time management, communication, deadline adherence |
| **Collaborative** | Team contribution, mentorship quality, feedback reception |
| **Metacognitive** | Self-assessment accuracy, learning strategy, adaptation |

### Employer Satisfaction Survey

Partner employers complete quarterly satisfaction assessments:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Project Value** | Did deliverables meet expectations? Would you use them? |
| **Talent Quality** | Would you consider hiring these students? |
| **Program Design** | Is the time investment worthwhile for your organization? |

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Collection Schedule

| Data Type | Frequency | Responsibility | Storage |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Attendance records | Weekly | Teacher mentors | Program database |
| Project milestones | Per project | Team leads | Project management system |
| Portfolio updates | Bi-weekly | Students | Portfolio platform |
| Employer ratings | Quarterly | External evaluator | Evaluation database |
| Student surveys | Quarterly | Program coordinator | Survey platform |
| Employment outcomes | 6-12 months post | External evaluator | Outcome database |

### Analysis Approach

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Descriptive statistics for all metrics
- Trend analysis across quarters
- Cohort comparison (Year 1 vs. future years)
- Subgroup analysis by demographics

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Thematic coding of reflection narratives
- Employer feedback pattern identification
- Student interview analysis
- Case study development for exemplar portfolios

:::tip Success Definition
The program succeeds when:
1. Employers validate that portfolios demonstrate genuine career readiness
2. Students secure pathways (employment, internships, advanced education) at rates exceeding non-participants
3. Partner employers request to continue and expand involvement
4. The model demonstrates replicability for other districts

## Longitudinal Tracking

Beyond Year 1 metrics, we will establish longitudinal tracking for:

| Timeframe | Metrics Tracked |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **1 Year Post-Graduation** | Employment status, wage level, AI tool usage in work |
| **3 Years Post-Graduation** | Career progression, role level, industry sector |
| **5 Years Post-Graduation** | Leadership positions, earnings trajectory, career satisfaction |

This longitudinal data will enable validation of the portfolio-based pathway approach and inform continuous program improvement.
