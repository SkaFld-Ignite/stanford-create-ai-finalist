# Budget

:::tip The First Dollar is the Hardest
**This is that dollar.** To build AI Studio Teams right—to create a scalable national platform that transforms how students prepare for AI-shaped careers—takes $1M. Stanford CREATE+AI is the **pre-seed leverage** that unlocks the rest.

This $50,000 investment provides the proof-of-concept that makes the larger vision fundable. Nothing is overhead—every dollar builds real infrastructure that delivers immediate value to pilot students and employers.

## $50,000 Resource Allocation

| Category | Amount | Percentage | Description |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Platform Development** | $20,000 | 40% | SkaFld Trailhead feature completion, AI coaching engine, portfolio system |
| **Pilot Implementation** | $12,000 | 24% | El Segundo coordination, employer onboarding, curriculum materials |
| **Assessment & Measurement** | $8,000 | 16% | Learning outcome tracking, portfolio evaluation, research documentation |
| **Operations & Contingency** | $10,000 | 20% | Legal/compliance, travel, admin overhead, and 6% buffer for unexpected costs |
| **Total** | **$50,000** | **100%** | |

## Budget Justification

### Platform Development ($20,000)

**Purpose:** Building the "SkaFld Trailhead" infrastructure that makes the model scalable beyond a single district.

- **AI Coaching Engine:** Completing the Socratic questioning module that guides students through problem decomposition.
- **Portfolio System:** Developing the employer-facing review portal for validated assessment.
- **Student Journey:** Finalizing the gamified progression paths for the pilot cohort.

**Why This Investment Matters:** This is the highest leverage investment. By digitizing the methodology into a platform, we move from a service-heavy consulting model to a scalable SaaS product that can reach thousands of districts.

### Pilot Implementation ($12,000)

**Purpose:** Ensuring the El Segundo pilot (96 students, 8 teams) is a resounding success.

- **Coordination:** On-the-ground management of weekly sessions and teacher mentor support.
- **Employer Onboarding:** Structured intake for the 12 employer partners providing projects.
- **Curriculum:** Adapting the "SkaFld Ideation Methodology" into classroom-ready guides.

### Assessment & Measurement ($8,000)

**Purpose:** Validating learning outcomes to prove the model works (crucial for Stanford alignment).

- **Outcome Tracking:** Measuring "decomposition thinking" and "AI literacy" gains.
- **Portfolio Evaluation:** Managing the external review process to ensure objectivity.
- **Research Documentation:** Capturing data for future grant applications and policy papers.

### Operations & Contingency ($10,000)

**Purpose:** Essential logistics and risk management.

- **Operations ($7k):** Covers travel for team coordination, legal compliance for student data privacy (COPPA/FERPA), and administrative overhead.
- **Contingency ($3k):** A standard buffer for unforeseen expenses during the 12-month pilot to ensure uninterrupted execution.

## Sustainability Plan: Year 2 and Beyond

Year 1 Stanford funding establishes the model and generates the evidence. **Year 2+ becomes self-sustaining** through recurring district contracts and employer partnerships—because we've proven the model works.

### Why This Becomes Fundable

The **$521/student** program cost (96 students / $50,000) is the key metric that unlocks sustainable funding. Districts and employers can budget for this—it's comparable to other CTE programs but with validated outcomes they can't get elsewhere.

| Revenue Source | Year 2+ Contribution | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **District CTE Budget Integration** | $20,000 | Districts allocate CTE funds for programs with proven employment outcomes |
| **Employer Partnership Contributions** | $15,000 | Companies invest in pipeline programs that deliver job-ready candidates |
| **Workforce Development Grants** | $10,000 | DOL and state workforce boards fund validated career pathways |
| **In-Kind Employer Contributions** | $10,000 | Project mentorship, facility access, internship slots |

**The Stanford CREATE+AI investment isn't the whole budget—it's the pre-seed leverage.** With Year 1 evidence in hand, we approach district superintendents and employer partners with a proven model at a fundable price point.

:::info Cost Efficiency Enables Scale
At **$521 per student** (96 students / $50,000), AI Studio Teams delivers employer-validated career preparation at a fraction of traditional workforce development program costs. This price point is the unlock: it's low enough for district CTE budgets, attractive enough for employer co-investment, and proven enough for workforce development grants. The per-student investment produces documented, verified capability that directly translates to employment opportunity—and that's the evidence that makes Year 2+ funding conversations possible.
