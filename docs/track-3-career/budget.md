## Budget Justification

### Portfolio Platform ($12,000)

**Purpose:** Central infrastructure enabling the entire portfolio-based pathway model

- Platform licensing with employer review capability: $8,000
- Configuration and customization for ESUSD context: $2,500
- Training and documentation development: $1,500

**Why This Investment Matters:** The portfolio platform is the persistent record of student capability. It must enable seamless employer access, structured feedback, and professional presentation. This is not a generic learning management system, but a purpose-built portfolio environment.

### Employer Engagement ($10,000)

**Purpose:** Securing and maintaining the employer partnerships that make authentic projects possible

- Partnership kickoff event (12 employers): $3,000
- Quarterly portfolio review panel hosting (4 events): $4,000
- Employer appreciation and recognition: $2,000
- Relationship management materials: $1,000

**Why This Investment Matters:** Employer commitment is the critical success factor. Without real projects and employer validation, the model fails. This investment ensures employers receive professional engagement commensurate with their contribution.

### Micro-Internship Coordination ($8,000)

**Purpose:** Connecting top performers with paid work experiences

- Placement matching and logistics: $3,000
- Supervision and quality assurance: $2,500
- Wage subsidies for pilot placements: $2,500

**Why This Investment Matters:** Micro-internships convert portfolio quality into actual employment pathway experience. These 10-20 hour placements demonstrate the direct connection between program participation and career opportunity.

### Teacher Mentor Stipends ($8,000)

**Purpose:** Recognizing the additional responsibilities of teacher mentors

- 8 teacher mentors at $1,000 each for annual program commitment
- Covers weekly session facilitation, student guidance, employer coordination

**Why This Investment Matters:** Teacher mentors are the consistent adult presence in the program. Their commitment extends beyond regular teaching duties and merits appropriate recognition.

### Additional Categories

**Curriculum Development ($5,000):** Session guides, mentor training, and AI tool integration materials that ensure consistent program quality across all 8 teams.

**Student Materials ($4,000):** Portfolio presentation supplies, professional headshots for portfolios, AI-Ready Certificate production, and team resources.

**Evaluation ($3,000):** External assessment support for objective outcome measurement and employer satisfaction analysis.

## Sustainability Plan

**Target:** Full operational sustainability by Year 3 through diversified funding and district integration.
