## The Unified Vision

All three tracks emerge from a single insight: **the traditional pathways to economic participation are breaking down**, and schools must transform to prepare students for an AI-native world.

| Challenge | Data Point |
|-----------|-----------|
| Entry-level jobs disappearing | 50% reduction in tech entry-level roles since 2019 |
| AI gender gap widening | Women are 16% less likely to use AI tools |
| Teachers unprepared | Majority lack structured AI training |
| Credentials losing value | Employers prioritize demonstrated capability over degrees |

The El Segundo AI Academy addresses all four challenges through an integrated three-tier approach targeting administrators, teachers, and students.
