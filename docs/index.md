# AI Studio Teams: Portfolio-Based Pathways to AI-Era Careers

**Stanford CREATE AI Challenge | Track 3: Augment Career Opportunities**

**Funding Request:** $50,000
**Implementation Partner:** El Segundo Unified School District
**Project Duration:** 12 months

---

## Executive Summary

The pathway from education to employment is breaking. As AI transforms the workforce, entry-level positions are disappearing at an alarming rate—creating an "experience paradox" where young people cannot gain experience because employers no longer offer the entry points that traditionally provided it.

**AI Studio Teams** addresses this crisis by creating a **farm system for talent development**—a structured approach to nurturing human potential that mirrors the sustained support model used in athletics. Our program replaces the broken credential-to-career pipeline with a portfolio-based pathway where high school students complete authentic projects for local employers, building verified evidence of their capability to work effectively in AI-augmented environments.

This proposal puts **educators and learners at the heart of AI design**—ensuring these tools expand access, agency, and connection, and in turn advance learning, well-being, and opportunity.

### The Innovation

Unlike traditional career preparation that relies on classroom simulation, AI Studio Teams operates at the intersection of three transformative approaches:

1. **Portfolio Over Credentials**: Students graduate with employer-validated work samples, not just transcripts
2. **Near-Peer Mentorship**: 12th graders mentor 10th graders; 11th graders mentor 9th graders, creating sustainable learning communities
3. **Employer Integration**: Local companies provide real projects, quarterly portfolio reviews, and micro-internship pathways

### Why El Segundo

**El Segundo Unified School District** serves 3,400+ students in a compact district (5 schools) with direct access to major employers including aerospace leaders (Boeing, Northrop Grumman), technology companies, and entertainment industry headquarters. This concentration enables authentic employer partnerships and **interdisciplinary practice** that would be impossible in larger, more dispersed districts.

## The Problem

The data reveals a crisis in entry-level employment:

| Indicator | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **40%** of employers plan workforce reductions due to AI | World Economic Forum, 2024 |
| **50%** reduction in tech entry-level roles since 2019 | LinkedIn Workforce Report |
| **80%** of hiring managers predict cuts to internships | Intelligent.com Survey, 2024 |

Students entering high school today will graduate into a workforce where traditional entry-level jobs are significantly reduced, AI will be standard in most knowledge work environments, and demonstrated capability—not credentials alone—will be the primary selection criterion.

**We have a 4-year window to prepare students for this reality.**

## Expected Outcomes (12 months)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Students with employer-validated portfolios | 96 students (8 teams of 12) |
| Employer partners providing real projects | 12 companies |
| Micro-internship placements | 24 students (25%) |
| Portfolio quality score (employer-rated) | 7.0/10 minimum |
| Gender parity in participation | 50/50 target |
