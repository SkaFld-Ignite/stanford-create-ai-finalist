# Equity-Centered AI Learning: K-12 Curriculum for All Learners

**Stanford CREATE AI Challenge - Track 2: Augment Learning**

**Funding Request:** $50,000
**Implementation Partner:** El Segundo Unified School District
**Project Duration:** 12 months

---

## Executive Summary

The El Segundo AI Academy proposes an **Equity-Centered K-12 AI Curriculum** designed to ensure all students, regardless of gender, disability, or socioeconomic status, can develop AI literacy and workforce-ready skills. This proposal directly addresses Track 2's focus on *"AI learning tools that foster participation, especially for learners with disabilities."*

### The Challenge

Current AI education perpetuates existing inequities:
- Women are **16% less likely** to use AI tools than men
- Only **22% of the AI workforce** is female
- Students with disabilities face significant barriers to AI tool access
- Inconsistent K-12 AI curriculum leaves most students unprepared

### Our Solution

We have developed a comprehensive K-12 AI curriculum framework with embedded equity mechanisms:

| Grade Band | Focus Area | Equity Feature |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| K-2 | AI Awareness | Universal design, multiple modalities |
| 3-5 | AI Literacy Basics | Bias awareness integrated from the start |
| 6-8 | AI Tool Proficiency & Ethics | Girls-only AI Studio Teams option |
| 9-12 | AI-Augmented Disciplinary Work | Accessible portfolio platforms |

### Innovation Highlights

1. **"50/50 by Design" Principle** - Gender parity required in all programming
2. **Safe Space First Pattern** - Girls-only teams show 5x higher retention (esports research)
3. **Universal Accessibility** - Device lending, school-day programming, multi-modal instruction
4. **Stereotype Threat Mitigation** - Research-based interventions embedded throughout

### Measurable Outcomes

By project end, we will achieve:
- **50% female participation** in AI programming (vs. 22% industry baseline)
- **100% accessibility compliance** across all learning materials
- **90%+ engagement scores** from underrepresented learners
- **3x increase** in girls expressing AI career interest

:::info Stanford Alignment
This proposal directly addresses Stanford CREATE AI Challenge evaluation criteria: **Innovation** (novel equity mechanisms), **Fairness & Inclusion** (core design principle), **Learning Sciences** (research-based interventions), and **Feasibility** (partnership with active school district).
